# Description

The Eye of the Ancients is an [[Arc Infinitus]] developed during the [[Age of Arcanum]] by the [[Netherese]].

When the Eye of the Ancients emits its special radiation, these high-energy particles would interact with the space-time fabric ([[Dunamis]]) in a similar way to matter and energy. Specifically, the energy carried by the radiation would create a localized distortion in the curvature of space-time, causing the boundaries between two parallel universes to become permeable. Like a rock dropped into standing water that causes ripples and disrupts the surface tensions of the water.

Properties:
- It is indestructible
- It's infused with the essence of [[Nulmoria]] and [[Tharizdun]]'s energy there

The multi-step process of merging two parallel universes once the artifact is activated:

1.  Activation: The attuned creature must first expend all remaining charges of the Eye of the Ancients and concentrate on the talisman for 1 hour. During this time, the attuned creature must remain still and cannot take any actions or be interrupted. The talisman glows brighter and brighter until it emits a blinding flash of light that engulfs the attuned creature and everything within a 100-foot radius.
2. The Convergence: The universes begin to converge, and strange things start to happen. The sky turns a deep shade of purple, and the stars appear to be moving and swirling around each other. The creatures from the two universes begin to interact, and some may even merge together or become new hybrid creatures. Plants and animals from both universes grow and thrive in the new, merged environment.
3. The Synthesis: The landscapes from both universes begin to fuse together, with mountains, forests, and rivers appearing in new and unexpected ways. Magical energies and spells from both universes start to interact, sometimes creating new and unpredictable effects. The attuned creature may even notice that their own abilities and memories are being affected by the merging of the two universes.
4. The Unification: As the Synthesis reaches its final stages, the attuned creature may notice that reality itself seems to be breaking down. The laws of physics, magic, and time begin to blur and combine, creating a new, unified reality that is unlike anything that has ever existed before. The attuned creature must make a DC 30 Intelligence saving throw to avoid being overwhelmed by the sheer power of the merging process.
5. The Completion: Once the merging is complete, the attuned creature and any creatures or objects that were within the 100-foot radius of the Eye of the Ancients' activation are transported to the new, merged reality. The Eye of the Ancients itself is destroyed in the process, leaving behind only a few fragments of the talisman and the memories of the incredible power it once possessed. The attuned creature must then try to navigate this new, strange reality and deal with the unpredictable consequences of the merging process.

1.  Activation: 3 months
2.  The Convergence: 3 months
3.  The Synthesis: 3 months
4.  The Unification: 3 months
5.  The Completion: instantaneous

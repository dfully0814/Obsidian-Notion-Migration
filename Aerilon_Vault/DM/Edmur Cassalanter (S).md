# Summary
Original patriarch of [[House Cassalanter]]

## Birth
Edmur was born in the nation of ‌[[Thay]] to ‌Zulkir [[Rivalen Tanthul]]. This birth occurred as a result of an illegal and secret union between [[Rivalen Tanthul]]‌ and a human mistress whose name has been lost to time. This mistress was purposefully kept shrouded in mystery, however. She was secretly a member of The [[Children of Malice]] and was intentionally planted among the magocracy of the Zulkirs in order to bring the bloodlines of ‌[[House Cassalanter]]] and ‌[[House Tanthul]] together.

## Military Service
Since he was an illegitimate son of ‌[[Rivalen Tanthul]]]'s, he was quickly maligned to the dregs of society in ‌[[Thaymount]] and disavowed by Tanthul himself, leaving him an orphan. In the ‌[[Thayan]] empire, any boy found orphaned is automatically conscripted into the nation's armed forces. Therefore, Edmur was enlisted in the [[Thayan]]‌ military at an early age.

He grew up in the [[Reformatories]] that the nation built for boys who were yet too young to fight. Here, boys would be indoctrinated in the ideologies of the empire and trained in both arcane and martial arts. He attained a nationalistic fervor as he grew, believing force of will outweighed compassion and care for purposes of protecting the empire and advancing it.

## Introduction to the Sirin
Military life was grueling for Edmur. Military service was a mandate for all boys once they reached 13 years old, but it was only the boys from noble families that would be allowed to advanced in rank and prominence. Orphans like Edmur were used primarily as fodder on the front lines of the battlefield to preserve the more valuable troops.

To survive the torment and ridicule he often received, Edmur increasingly turned to reading books and finding solace in knowledge of the world. He wanted to know the world outside of the walls of the ‌[[Reformatories]]. He discovered that he had a seemingly unnatural photographic memory, being able to recall concepts by page, row, and column from books he would read.

He began to read many different documents related to the history of ‌[[Toril]], particularly the [[Calamity]]. He learned about the nation's founding after the [[Shadow War]]  and was drawn by the apparent noble leadership of ‌Zulkir [[Alina Baenre]] and her demonstrated devotion to her people and the ‌[[Sirin]]. Seeing the economy of slavery that had arisen in [[Thayan]] along with the cruelty of much of the Thayan leadership, Edmur became more and more drawn to stories he read about the nation's founding, comparing its founded state to its current state and longing for a different time.

At the time, the ‌[[Thayan]] empire had begun persecuting and enforcing the disbanding of all deity worship as tensions among the Thayan ‌[[Council of Eight]] had already begun to rise, particularly between ‌Zulkir ‌[[Alina Baenre]] and Z‌ulkir ‌[[Telamont Tanthul]]. For a long period, Edmur remained quiet and stayed out of the focus of the [[Thayan]] Archmages, continuing to fight for his life during the day and learn in the evening.

## Meeting Tanthul
Unbeknown to Edmur, the first [[Shadow Crossing]] had opened in ‌[[Thaymount]], beginning to corrupt the more intellectually astute who were within its reach.

As Edmur deepened his studies of the ‌[[Sirin]], he began to have dreams of a tremendous flaming eye looking down upon him, which he interpreted to be a ‌[[Sirin]]] reaching out to him and rewarding him for his diligent seeking of their wisdom and teachings. He soon became convinced he had been chosen by the ‌[[Sirin]]] to unite his people in worship and service to the ‌[[Sirin]], effectively ending the warfare, slavery, and butchery that was quickly categorizing his people. In these visions, he was told by the eye that his half-brother was [[Telamont Tanthul]]‌, which put him in great fear knowing of Tanthul's affluence and power in the empire. The eye gave him the task of revealing himself to Tanthul as his family and that Tanthul would then set him on a path to fulfilling his goal of bringing peace and prosperity to the empire.

Knowing he would likely be unable to gain an audience with Tanthul using conventional means, he managed to add himself to the security detail of Tanthul's while Tanthul was traveling on a diplomatic mission. At some point during their travels, he revealed himself to Tanthul as his half-brother, told Tanthul of his many visions of the eye, and told him the eye had sent him to Tanthul and told him of their relation.

## The First Dreadmaster
Edmur was stunned when [[Telamont Tanthul]]‌ became enraged and called his other guards to arrest Edmur and bind him in chains. Tanthul then read his thoughts in order to see if he was secretly an assassin, discovering that Edmur believed himself to be telling the truth. Concluding that he was simply a crazed worshiper of a deity, Tanthul executed Edmur on the spot. [[Tharizdun]]s‌ influence had already taken hold of Edmur, however. ‌[[Tharizdun]] had chosen to use Edmur to accomplish his greater plans. Since Edmur's intellect was much higher than normal, he could not fully control Edmur and was unable to transform Edmur into a ‌[[Shadovar]]. As ‌[[Tharizdun]]] reached out to control Edmur's fleeting memory, his essence mixed with Edmur's intellect and charisma, transforming him into a ‌[[Dreadmasters]]. The process of his transformation took several days after Tanthul and his men buried Edmur. To ‌[[Telamont Tanthul]]'s shock, Edmur appeared to him once again in his ‌[[Dreadmasters]]] form.

Admiring his power more than wanting to believe his tales of visions and deity, ‌[[Telamont Tanthul]]] chose to learn more. This sent Tanthul down a path of obsessive study and research into the nature of the ‌[[Darkweave]]] which had transformed Edmur.

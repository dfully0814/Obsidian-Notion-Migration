# Summary
- Rashad was born and raised in the Al-Nurak tribe. His parents were both respected members of the tribe, known for their wisdom and fairness. From a young age, Rashad was instilled with the values of the Al-Nurak - equality, unity, and collective strength.
- As he grew older, Rashad showed a natural aptitude for leadership. He was often the one to mediate disputes and help make collective decisions. When the former Shiek passed away, the tribe was in consensus that Rashad would be his successor. The decision was not based on any personal achievement or prowess but on Rashad's commitment to the tribe and his understanding of the Al-Nurak's values.
- Rashad's leadership has been marked by a focus on maintaining the tribe's unity and collective strength. Despite the rising tensions over the [[Zemari Spring]], Rashad has consistently advocated for dialogue and peaceful resolution, staying true to the [[Al-Nurak]]'s principles. He believes that the tribes can find a way to coexist and share the spring, preserving the balance in the desert.

# Motivations

# Relationships

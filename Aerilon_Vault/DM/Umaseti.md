# Crime and Punishment
In the Umaseti tribe, the concept of a trial does exist, but it doesn't necessarily follow the formal structured process you might expect in a modern legal system. Given the tribe's individualistic philosophy, the process is more personal and direct.

When an accusation is made, the accused is given a chance to defend themselves in front of the accuser and a gathering of tribe members. The accuser presents their case, bringing forth any evidence or witnesses they may have, and the accused responds with their own evidence, witnesses, or arguments.

Sheikh [[Farid Al-Din]] or a designated elder may preside over this process, ensuring fairness and that both parties are heard. They may also ask questions to get a clearer understanding of the situation. However, the ultimate decision is typically left to the accuser and the accused, who must reach a resolution between themselves, often through negotiation or a duel of honor in case of personal disputes.

It is only when an agreement cannot be reached, or the crime is severe (such as murder), that the Sheikh or designated elder may intervene with a judgement or proposed solution. In these cases, the Sheikh's word is final, and his decisions are respected throughout the tribe.

# Laws
1.  **Personal Responsibility:** The individual responsible for a crime must accept the consequences. The tribe doesn't interfere unless it directly affects their collective security.
2.  **Reparation:** In cases of theft or damage to property, the offender must replace the stolen item or repair the damage they caused, sometimes with an added compensation depending on the severity of the crime.
3.  **Duel of Honor:** For personal disputes, the tribe respects the tradition of a duel of honor, a one-on-one fight to resolve the issue. The victor's stance is considered just.
4.  **Exile:** In extreme cases, where a member continually disrupts the peace or commits a heinous crime, they may be exiled from the tribe.
5.  **Negotiation:** The Umaseti law permits the accused to negotiate their way out of a penalty if they can convince the victim or their family, reinforcing the individualistic nature of the tribe.

# Capital Punishment
- Capital punishment is reserved for the most severe crimes and is seen as an individual's failure to respect the principles of freedom and personal responsibility. Crimes that could potentially lead to capital punishment include murder, treason, or any action that puts the entire tribe in extreme danger. The decision is made by the victim's family, reinforcing the tribe's focus on individual judgement and responsibility. The execution is swift and is often carried out by a designated member of the tribe.

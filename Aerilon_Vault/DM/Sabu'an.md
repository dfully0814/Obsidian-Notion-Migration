# Summary
- Used by the [[Umaseti]] and [[Al-Nurak]] as well as other nomadic tribes to help with many daily tasks such as carrying water from the [[Zemari Spring]] and other transportation
- These creatures could serve multiple purposes within the tribe beyond transportation. Their antlers are used for various tools and crafting needs. Their thick hides provide much-needed leather for clothing and other goods. They could also serve as a source of meat in desperate times.
- For the [[Umaseti]], owning a strong and healthy [[Sabu'an]] could be seen as a symbol of a family's wealth and status. In the [[Al-Nurak]] tribe, the communal care and training of the [[Sabu'an]] could be a significant part of their collective responsibility and work ethic. The most majestic and well-cared-for [[Sabu'an]] could be seen as a symbol of the tribe's overall health and prosperity.

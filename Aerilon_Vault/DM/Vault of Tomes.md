# Summary
- The Vault of Tomes is a network of underground areas under [[Neverwinter Castle]]. 
- These were built by the long-standing royal family [[House Alagondar]] that occupied the seat of power in [[Neverwinter]] for centuries since its founding before the last of the family were killed in the eruption of [[Mt Hotenow]]. 
- The characters will discover the first [[Aerilon]] noble family to be corrupted by [[Tharizdun]] directly. 
# Important Locations
![[alagondar hold.png]]
- For Tiers 1 and 2, use the map above
- The hold consists of three tiers. Ceilings in rooms and hallways are 15 feet high unless stated otherwise. The floors are smooth stone polished to a mirror finish.
- The uppermost tier of the Hold closely resembles the style and architecture of the family manor in Waterdeep before it was destroyed. This section of the hold resembles a mausoleum. The Far Realm’s influence on this tier is faint.

Two members of the Alagondar family reside here: a wizard named [Melissara Alagondar](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/277605-melissara-Alagondar) and her mad husband, [Derrion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/277609-derrion-Alagondar).

## Tier 1
The uppermost tier of Alagondar Hold closely resembles the style and architecture of the family manor in [[Waterdeep]] before it was destroyed. This section of the hold resembles a mausoleum. The [[Transitory Plane]] influence on this tier is faint.

**1. Grand Foyer**
Grand Entryways chamber to the rest of the hold from the tunnel system:

> Pillars. Pillars support the 40-foot-high, vaulted ceiling.
> 
> Grells. Six [grells](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/17157-grell) float behind the pillars to the north. The grells attack visitors and can use their tentacles to open and close doors as needed.
> 
> Apparitions. Spectral images of dead servants and adventurers occasionally fade into view, wander the hall, then fade away. 
> 
> Statues. Statues depicting two well-dressed humans stand in alcoves to the south.

The statues show the Alagondar twins, Zalthar and Dezmyr, as they appeared in life. Zalthar’s statue is in the west alcove and stands 6 feet 11 inches tall. Dezmyr’s statue to the east stands 6 feet 3 inches tall. An inscription on the bottom of each statue identifies its subject.

**2. Twisted Gallery**
> Bas-Reliefs. The curved walls are lined with bas-relief carvings, and plaques mounted beneath them tell the story of a forgotten Waterdavian family.
> 
> Statues. Two 9-foot-tall statues stand on raised platforms in alcoves to the north and south.

The bas-reliefs carvings depict [[Arandraya]], [[Maelweene]], and [[Yarlithra Alagondar]] negotiating trade deals in [[Waterdeep]], exploring Undermountain in their free time, pouring treasure into family coffers, and giving a black tablet to their brother, Xerrion. The carvings go on to show the original Alagondar Hold (in Waterdeep) on fire, Xerrion Alagondar escaping into Undermountain with the black tablet, the creation of a new Alagondar Hold in the dungeon’s depths, Xerrion’s marriage to Lady Margaraste, and the married couple stepping through a gate of tentacles into the Far Realm.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ([History](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#History)) check identifies the family crest in the reliefs — a lit torch with an orange flame and three embers trailing off it — and the two mottoes of House Alagondar: “No secrets without truth” and “We do not fear the darkness.” The crest appears upright in earlier scenes and inverted in later scenes. A character who recognizes the crest and the family mottoes also knows that the Alagondars were presumed destroyed.

The statue to the north depicts Lord Xerrion Alagondar, a male human of middle age with regal bearing and sharp features. The south statue depicts Lady Margaraste Alagondar, a middle-aged female human with long, curly hair and a kind smile. An inscription on the bottom of each statue identifies its subject.

- **Warded Vaults**
	![](https://i.imgur.com/VXuZ5et.jpg)
	
	- Each of the vaults are warded by magic runes inscribed into them. When the vault door is closed and locked, the runes glow orange. These runes can be detected as powerful abjuration and transmutation. 
	- When the vault doors are closed, they provide the following effects inside each vault room
		- Time stasis: Time stops so anything in the vault does not age or show signs of wear to forever preserve what's inside
		- Protection from Evil and Good: The room is under the effect of [Protection from Evil and Good](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-evil-and-good)
		- The room is encased in an [Antimagic Field](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/antimagic-field)
		- The room is under the effects of [Nondetection](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/nondetection)
		- Vacuum sealed: All the air is sucked out of the room to inhibit anyone who might break into the vault
		- The vault cannot be opened from the inside
	- **Opening a vault**
		- This requires a [[Skill Challenge]]
		- Base DC for each complication: 10 + (2 x Party avg proficiency bonus). 18 in this case
		- Requires 7 successes before 3 Failures
		- Complications
			- Bypassing mechanical locks (base DC 22)
			- Bypassing arcane locks (base DC 24)
			- If the active characters on each are proficient with the tools or skills they use, the DC decrease by the proficiency bonus
			- 1st failure, the vault fires a [Confusion](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/confusion) spell (DC 20)
			- 2nd failure, Confusion spell (DC 20) + summons an [Iron Golem](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16935-iron-golem)
			- 3rd failure, Confusion spell + triggers alarm alerting the [[Everwatch Knights]] in the [[Hall of Knowledge]]
- **Sunken Stacks**
	- A pit that has opened up in the ground from which a shadowy essence is billowing out and filling the entirety of the vault. Dark words are whispering from the pit. This will act as an ongoing hazard to the players while they are in the Vault. The only way to avoid the whispers is to deafen themselves, use a spell like Protection from Evil and Good or enter a vault and close the door. 
	- Every minute, any creature in the Vault must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 18), on a failure the player will suffer a short-term madness condition. At the end of each round, the player can making a wisdom saving throw to end the condition. If a player takes a second short-term madness condition while having an active short-term condition, it results in a long-term madness condition.  On a critical failure, the player suffers an indefinite madness condition. If a character has a long-term madness condition and suffers a second long-term madness condition, the player suffers an Indefinite Madness condition instead.
	- The pit appears endlessly deep
- **Facing the Drow**
	- When the characters enter the vault and leading up to it, they will see signs that someone or something has made it to the vault before them. When they get to the vault, they will find a band of [[Drow]] attempting to break into a vault in the **Secondary Stacks** area. These have come up through the pit in the middle of the vault from [[Nulmoria]] to steal one of the [[Sirin Beacons]].
	- The group will consist of:
		- [Drow House Wizard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2964655-drow-house-wizard)
		- [Drow Shadowblade](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/2560790-drow-shadowblade)

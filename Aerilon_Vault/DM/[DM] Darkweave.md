## Origins

Caused by the influence of [[Tharizdun]] upon the [[Prime Material Plane]] as more [[Shadow Crossing]] have begun opening across [[Toril]].

## Causes

The disease slowly spreads as [[Tharizdun]] presence affects cities one by one. It can infect half of a city’s population in a mere week. People can be infected by Darkweave either by coming near [[Tharizdun]] aura near a [[Shadow Crossing]] or a more powerful thrall of [[Tharizdun]] such as a [[Shadovar]] or [[Dreadmasters]] or another more powerful creature fully transformed by the disease.

See [[Shadow Crossing]] for more info on saving throw tiers.

## Symptoms

What does the infection look like?

Enhanced “core memories” followed by a loss of them like long-term memory loss. As the identity is consumed, the person infected starts exhibiting physical symptoms like graying skin, elongated appendages, and other anatomical changes. This happens because the Darkweave is tricking the brain into believing it is from the [[Nulmoria]] and always has been. The body, therefore, begins to physically adapt to that environment.

## Diagnosis

More powerful thralls of Tharizdun like [[Shadovar]] and [[Dreadmasters]] wear mementos that were special to them in life in order to keep the power of their memory as closely tethered to the world as possible because the presence of memory not consumed in the presence of Tharizdun is the most powerful.

Less powerful and average creatures infected by the Darkweave will first exhibit mental symptoms of enhanced long-term memory and then loss of those memories or at least difficulty apprehending those memories at the early stages.

## Cure

How is the patient cured? What can others do to help?

Removing your memory so that the Darkweave cannot feed on it. Or implant the memories of someone else into you so that the Darkweave will feed on those memories but not consume you along with them since they are not your memories and not your identity.

Also, having no memories at all.

# Becoming Shiek
Farid al-Din was always known for his keen intellect and quick wit. He was not the strongest warrior nor the most successful hunter, but his intelligence often solved problems that brute force could not. When the time came to choose a new Sheikh, Farid, despite his lack of physical prowess, put himself forward as a candidate.

The challenge he chose was to create a new trade route to a distant city that would allow the Umaseti tribe to trade their goods more profitably and efficiently. Many were skeptical, considering the city's notorious reputation for treacherous terrain and hostile inhabitants. However, Farid was confident in his plan.

Farid spent days meticulously planning the route, accounting for every possible difficulty. He studied the terrain, established contingency plans, and even learned the basics of the city's language to negotiate better.

When the day of departure arrived, Farid led a small caravan along the route he had planned. They faced multiple challenges on the way: hostile wildlife, harsh weather, and terrain that was even more treacherous than expected. However, Farid's careful planning and quick thinking saw them through each difficulty.

When they finally reached the city, Farid successfully negotiated trade terms that greatly favored the Umaseti. The caravan returned home laden with goods and stories of their journey, and Farid was hailed as a hero.

His successful endeavor demonstrated not just his intelligence but also his courage, leadership, and dedication to his tribe. Impressed by his abilities, the Umaseti tribe chose Farid al-Din as their new Sheikh. Farid's success story remains a testament to the tribe's belief in the power of individual intellect and determination.

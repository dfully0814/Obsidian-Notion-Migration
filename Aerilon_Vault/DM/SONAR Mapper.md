# Significance
This device uses high frequency sounds to create a map of solid objects within 100 feet of the user. It is stopped by walls and only goes 10 feet beyond any corner the sound must go around. Moving objects and creatures caught in the mapper show up as blinking dots that appear in new places every few seconds as they move. The sound waves hit solid objects and therefore go through any illusion that does not have a tactile component. That means that illusions such as silent image are not seen with a sonar mapper while ones from spells such as mirage arcana are. In addition, invisible creatures can be found with the mapper as they show up as moving dots while moving or otherwise as obstructions. The walls created by the map are approximate and objects up against solid walls end up blending in with the wall itself. Therefore an invisible creature could stay still against a wall and be invisible to the mapper. The mapper has a clearly audible sound, essentially eliminating any attempt at stealth. The mapper requires an atmosphere to work and therefore doesnâ€™t operate in a vacuum. It does have double the working distance underwater, however. You must be proficient in scanning tools to be able to operate this device, but it requires no ability check.

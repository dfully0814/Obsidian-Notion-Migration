The Kerrumian people have always been ones who persistently sat on the edge of emerging knowledge and technology although they remain as devoted to faith and religion as their ancestors. Knowledge and faith have always run in close parallel for the Kerrumian people. Wars have often resulted over one or the other and sometimes both.

The technical prowess of the Kerrumians skyrocketed when a large mine was discovered containing a dark orange mineral the Kerrumian people now call [[Kasika]] when the mineral is in its refined gem form. After studying this mineral's properties for generations, Kerrumian sages began to understand the mineral had the ability to hold large amounts of highly volatile energy in stasis for long periods of time.

They soon began to find all sorts of uses for Kasika—powering cities, weapons, armor, and other cutting-edge technological advancements.

With the increasing amount of technological advancement and influence, the Kerrumians began to face internal conflict. Disagreements regarding the partitioning of Kasika to the various tribes across the continent and potential trade of Kasika to other nations from Kerruma's coastal cities resulted in various factions forming across the land, often being determined by the shared patron god a tribe was devoted to since the personality and values of a god would largely influence a tribe's worldview and decision-making in all aspects of life.

Among the wars and violence that arose across the Kerruma rose High Priest of Set, [[Septizim Gamal]], a well-known, ancient, and long-dead Pharaoah of Kerruma who oversaw Kerruma's most prosperous gold-age period when the Kasika mines were first discovered. No one knows how or why the Pharaoh was returned alive to the lands of [[Kerruma]].

It did not take Septizim long to win the hearts and minds of the people of Kerruma through his display of power over death and other mysterious abilities. He quickly gathered armies and subdued all rebelling tribes across Kerruma, uniting the land under the banner of devotion to the god Set.

The high priest has not subdued all tribes, however. The equally ancient and formidable tribe called the [[Ha'Kari]] remains in opposition to the Pharaoah. The Ha'Kari devote themselves to the god [[Horus]] who is often depicted with the iconography of a falcon and is associated with war, hunting and is known as the god of the skies.

Both the Ha'Kari and those devoted to [[Set]] believe that Horus and Set are mortal enemies and that Horus once killed one of Set's brothers in a violent conflict and in retaliation Set gouged out Horus' left eye. The Ha'Kari have now come to believe the sun and moon represent the right and left eyes of Horus, respectively.

Because of this belief, the Ha'Kari closely monitor the cycles of the moon. Whenever a new moon occurs, the Ha'Kari see this as the god Horus restoring order from the chaos that Set has inflicted on the world.

The Ha'Kari are industrious people, primarily subsisting off of the trade of tamed wild and exotic beasts from their coastal city of [[Kusma]], the last large city and bastion of hope for the Ha'Karian people and the capital of [[Kerruma]].

Within the city of Kusma, stands the most significant religious and academic institution left to the Ha'Karian people, the [[Temple of the New Moon]]. Here, Ha'Karian men and women come to learn academics, religion, and martial prowess.

In the temple, sits a large golden brazier the Ha'Karians call [[The Asim]]. It's here that Ha'Karians in good standing with the tribe are burned after death in order to protect a loved Ha'Karian's body from High Priest Septizim's influence after death and entrust their ashes to the god of the sky.

While the Ha’Kari stands at the front lines facing the persecution of the Septizim, there are countless other tribes of various sizes facing their own conflicts

# Culture

The culture of Kerruma will be different from what we’ve been used to in [[Aerilon]]. Kerrumian culture draws almost exclusively on ancient Arabic and Persian cultures. Take this into consideration when you consider your character’s motivations and their names. See below for some examples of typical Kerrumian names:

-   Asad Al-Nuri
-   Neha Zahi
-   Khepsura Neferu
-   Kaveh Mubarak
-   Aziz Osiris
-   Darius El-Masri

Kerruma is a desert continent in the world of Toril made up of many different cultures, tribes, and nations--some living in bustling cities like that of Alexandria in ancient Egypt, and others living among the dunes battling the harsh blistering winds (that’s you). 

# Narrative Intro

In the vast expanse of the [[Kerruma]] desert, far from the bustling cities and the coastal capital of [[Kusma]], lies a well of great significance. This well, known as the [[Zemari Spring]], is a vital source of life in the unforgiving landscape. The name Zemari, meaning "sustainer" in the ancient Kerrumian language, reflects the essential role it plays for those who depend on its waters.

Two nomadic tribes lay claim to the Zemari Spring. The first tribe, known as the [[Al-Nurak]], are a proud and resourceful people who have roamed the desert sands for generations, finding much spiritual, cultural, and religious significance in the successful establishment of the Zemari Spring in the ancient times of their ancestors, believing their ancestors to have originally been lead to this natural well by the gods. The encampment of the Al-Nurak, known as [[Enjara]], is a temporary oasis, always ready to be disassembled and moved as the tribe traverses the desert. What was previously mostly tents that could be easily disassembled, [[Enjara]] has become a more permanent village in the past several generations after the discovery of the Zemari Spring as clay dwellings have been erected with thatch roofs. The village serves as a gathering place for the [[Al-Nurak]] people, a site for trade and celebrations, and a sanctuary from the harsh desert environment.

The second tribe, the [[Umaseti]], are equally resilient and skilled in navigating the desert landscape. They have a deep familial connection to the much larger warrior tribe known as the [[Ha'Kari]] who populate much of the capital city of Kusma and share similar customs and beliefs in their devotion to the god [[Horus]]. The Umaseti's encampment, called [[Makirah]], is another temporary haven in the desert, where the tribe comes together to uphold their traditions and plan their future journeys.

For centuries, the Al-Nurak and Umaseti tribes coexisted in relative harmony, sharing the life-giving waters of the Zemari Spring in a delicate balance. They understood that cooperation and respect were essential for their mutual survival in the unforgiving desert. However, as the years went by and the tribes grew in number, the pressure on the Zemari Spring increased. Tensions began to rise between the Al-Nurak and Umaseti, each tribe growing more protective of the precious resource.

Cultural differences began to affect how each tribe approached distributing the well’s resources. The Al-Nurak tribe typically follows a more collectivist ideology, emphasizing communal ownership of resources and the importance of sharing equally among all members. They believe that the water of the Zemari Spring should be allocated based on need, with each family or individual receiving a fair share according to their requirements. This approach fosters a strong sense of community within the tribe, as members support and look out for each other in times of scarcity.

In contrast, the Umaseti tribe adheres to a more individualistic philosophy, valuing personal achievement and self-reliance. They believe that water from the Zemari Spring should be earned through hard work and merit, with each member responsible for securing their own share. This mindset encourages competition and personal growth within the tribe, as members strive to excel and prove their worth.

The uneasy peace between the tribes was shattered when a severe drought struck the region. The once-abundant Zemari Spring began to dwindle, its waters no longer sufficient to sustain both tribes. Desperation set in, and the Al-Nurak and Umaseti found themselves locked in a bitter struggle for control of the Zemari Spring.

This conflict, fueled by generations of shared history and rivalry, erupted into a violent confrontation between the two tribes. The sands of the Kerruma desert, once a testament to their unity and cooperation, now bore witness to the bloodshed and destruction caused by their desperate battle for survival.

As the conflict raged on, the future of both the Al-Nurak and Umaseti tribes hung in the balance. With the Zemari Spring's waters running ever lower, it became clear that only one tribe would ultimately prevail, while the other faced the unforgiving reality of the desert. The fate of these two tribes would be determined by their determination, cunning, and the strength of their resolve to survive.

# Session Zero

Before the first session, think about which tribe your character grew up in and how that affects his or her motivations, flaws, and bonds. We will then informally discuss how you formed relationships with one another over the years, even if you are members of different tribes. Based on where we land with who is in which tribe, we will talk about how the conflict over the Zemari Spring has affected your relationships and what you have done to adapt. This will allow us all to write the first part of the story together and go from there before we begin the first scene.

# Description

These are ancient artifacts left over from the [[Age of Arcanum]] fashioned by the [[Netherese]] at powerful magical points called a [[Singularity]] where connections across the [[Weave]] form into a concentrated nexus and tend to be powerful spots of magic.

Known Arc Infiniti:
- [[Sirin Beacons]]
	- Power has something to do with memory / rebirth / time
- [[Eye of the Ancients]]
	- When the Eye of the Ancients emits its special radiation, these high-energy particles would interact with the space-time fabric ([[Dunamis]]) in a similar way to matter and energy. Specifically, the energy carried by the radiation would create a localized distortion in the curvature of space-time, causing the boundaries between two parallel universes to become permeable. Like a rock dropped into standing water that causes ripples and disrupts the surface tensions of the water.
- [[Yang Tieh]]'s spear
	- Controlling elements / ordering the [[Primordials]]

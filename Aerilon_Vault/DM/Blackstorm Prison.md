- Located on the secluded island known as [[Fire Island]] in the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]
- Located in the [[Uncharted North]]
- Located due north of the [[Ironhaven]] settlement of [[Lonelywood]]
- Formerly a monastery converted to a prison during the time of the
- Holds individuals convicted of the most serious crimes committed against the realm such as arcane users held for questioning or coercion, those given lengthy sentences, political dissidents, treason, etc.
- All prisoners wear unremarkable hoodless robes, given a unique identifying number, and bound in heavy manacles on wrists and ankles when not in the cell.
- The most significant punishment of prisoners is extreme isolation. Upon arrival, each prison is put into a cell with other inmates. Few distractions are allowed, certainly not TV or books. During the daytime the bed is stowed away, and the inmates are forced to stand, or sit on a tiny wooden perch a few inches wide. This goes on for 22 hours and a half a day, every single day.
- Misbehaving prisoners are sent to be locked for a minimum of 15 days in a small, dark room with only a metal bucket as company.
- For the first 10 years, inmates are allowed only two visits a year. Each visit can last no longer than two hours. Inmates get two additional visits after 10 years but at a shorter duration (30 minutes each). Because of this, by the time 10 years have passed most prisoners have lost all contact with their families.
- Inmates are able to receive parcels from family and friends, but these are limited to only two per year
- Exercise - Inmates are allowed to walk in the open for an hour and a half a day in cages sized 7ft x 7ft
- When an inmate dies, if his body is unclaimed by relatives, it's taken to a small village graveyard near [[Fire Island]]. Bodies are buried with little ceremony under markers bearing serial numbers instead of names. No prisoners are allowed to attend burials.
- Many prisoners attempt self-harm to have themselves transferred to the more peaceful medical wards for a temporary time.
- Many inmates seek religion to cope with the crushing isolation and life-threatening situation in which they live.
- The long-term isolation causes prisoners to psychologically break apart
	- Hypersensitivity to external stimuli, perceptual distortions, illusions, and hallucinations, panic attacks, and RETAINING MEMORIES
	- Once you start losing memories and you don't have the opportunity to create new ones, that's when your whole personality, your own self starts to fade away
	- Symptoms of isolation are most closely associated to symptoms of Delirium, caused by physical abnormalities on the brain
- Each cell contains 3-4 inmates

# Important Locations
- **Wide Perimeter**
	- Constructs maintain patrols around a 24 mile perimeter surrounding the island. These are typically less expensive constructs that are used more for reconnaissance and will alert the prison of any threats. Response?
- *Walls**
	- The prison is surrounded by two sets of walls each 40ft high
	- 5ft thick
- **Watchtowers**
		- There are watchtowers at every corner of each wall, 8 in total
		- [[Everwatch Knights]] inhabit the towers
- **Patrols**
	- Constructs patrol the inside and outside perimeters of the walls. They are powered by [[Dragon Amber]] which the [[Everwatch Knights]] use to connect to them and control them telepathically. If the [[Dragon Amber]] is removed from them, they would both lose power and connection to the knights, but the knight controlling them would know the connection has been lost.
- **Getting In/Out**
	- Only two ways in and out of the island:
		- Prison boat
		- Along a narrow wooden bridge
	- If a prisoner successfully escaped the island, they would have to either swim in 1 mile to shore in freezing waters or navigate the wooden bridge while being shot at from guard towers and pursued.
- **Wooden Bridge**
	- 1500ft long, 30ft clearance underneath
	- Connects to a small village where many of the guards live and where the prisoner graveyard is located

As the relentless sun sets over the harsh landscape of Kerruma, a solitary figure, astride a sturdy [[Sabu'an]], crests a dune followed by a small group of warriors brandishing long muzzle rifles. Farid Al-Din, Shiek of the Umaseti, surveys the once peaceful Zemari Spring, now a contested battlefield between his people and the Al-Nurak tribe. His heart is heavy with the weight of responsibility and the cost of the conflict.

An unexpected flash of movement catches his eye. Through the falling dusk, he spies a group of Al-Nurak attempting a night raid on the spring. They move stealthily, their every action coordinated with practiced precision. Farid clenches his fists, his knuckles white against the reins of his Yabani. He knows he must alert his warriors, but he also understands that every confrontation, every skirmish, only deepens the divide between the tribes, pushing a peaceful resolution further out of reach.

Suddenly, a chilling howl cuts through the evening silence - the distinctive call of a desert predator, perhaps attracted by the scent of conflict. As Farid turns his gaze towards the source of the sound, a terrifying realization strikes him - the Al-Nurak raiding party, their attention focused solely on the spring, is unaware of the impending danger.

Farid is torn. He has the chance to let the desert take care of his 'enemies', or he can intervene, potentially saving the Al-Nurak party but alerting them to his presence. As he grapples with the decision, he understands that his next move could not only determine the course of the war but also define who he is as a leader.

In this moment, the readers are thrust into the stark reality of the war between the Umaseti and the Al-Nurak, and the difficult choices their leaders must face. They see firsthand the real-world implications of the tribal philosophies and the desperate struggle for the life-giving Zemari Spring. A tale of survival, leadership, and the cost of conflict unfolds, promising a riveting journey through the sands of Kerruma.

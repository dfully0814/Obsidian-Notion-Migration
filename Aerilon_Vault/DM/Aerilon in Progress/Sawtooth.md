![[sawtooth 1.webp]]

# Behavior
-   Behaves like an apex predator in the form of a sabre-tooth cat.

# Appearance
-   It is heavyset at the front, with a large, broad chest, neck, and shoulders, powerful legs, and no tail.
-   Its mouth is equipped with a pair of curved, scimitar-like serrated spikes, like a saber-toothed cat's fangs.
-   Two optical sensor arrays are located on its face, in the same position as a saber-toothed catâ€™s eyes. Each is composed of two sensors in a vertical configuration.
-   A long, metal crest-like structure runs along the forward area of its back, and an array of three long antenna-like structures protrude from its back in a fan-like pattern, just behind the shoulders. Its paws are equipped with non-retractable claws. The shoulders, head, and neck are heavily armored.

# Abilities
-   Despite its size and heavyset chassis, a Sawtooth is highly agile and is capable of great speed. It is designed for rapid sprinting and pouncing, and will very quickly close the distance to an identified threat.
-   Their attacks center on lunging with violent claw slashes and bites, giving enemies little time to retaliate.

# History
- Possibly originated from a [[Netheril Empire]] under the [[Reghed Glacier]]

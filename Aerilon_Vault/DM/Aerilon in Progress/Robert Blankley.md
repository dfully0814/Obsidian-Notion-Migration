# Summary
A powerful slaver ([[Blazbaard Glagaaz]]) made him what he is. A serious injury left his mother unemployed and in need of constant care. His family became saddled with debt trying to care for his infirm mother. He has made many enemies by not giving into corruption and outing many instances of it.

Despite appearing to always be eating or chewing on something, he is slight and small with mousy eyes and a diminutive chin.

His stringy black hair hangs below his shoulders and looks more like severed seaweed than human hair. He dresses in plain clothes except for his boots. They are meticulously maintained and polished and look to be of the finest make. Born to a poor family. Made a living as a petty thief. He was beaten and robbed on the road by those to whom he owes significant debts.

He now serves as first mate aboard the [[Anguila]].

# Description

Timeline displacement can have a wide range of physical and psychological symptoms, depending on how severe the displacement is and how long it lasts. Here are a few possibilities:

1.  Memory Loss: Mera may experience gaps in her memory or difficulty remembering events that have happened. She may also have trouble distinguishing between events that happened in different timelines.
    
2.  Deja Vu: Mera may experience intense feelings of deja vu or have a sense of familiarity with events that are happening for the first time. This could be caused by memories from different timelines bleeding through into her current timeline.
    
3.  Time Dilation: Mera may experience time passing at different rates in different timelines. This could lead to her feeling like time is moving too quickly or too slowly.
    
4.  Temporal Paralysis: Mera may become temporarily paralyzed in certain timelines or moments, unable to move or take any actions until the timeline shifts again.
    
5.  Temporal Disorientation: Mera may become disoriented or confused about her location or situation, as she is constantly shifting between different timelines.
    
6.  Emotional Instability: Mera may experience intense emotional swings, as she is constantly shifting between different versions of herself with different emotional experiences.
    
7.  Existential Crisis: Mera may begin to question her own existence and whether she has any control over her own life, as she is constantly shifting between different versions of herself and different timelines.

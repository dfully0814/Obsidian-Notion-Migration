# Description
A mysterious phenomenon that began to occur during the [[Calamity]] when [[Tharizdun]], seeking to upend and annihiliate the [[Sirin]] and their ability to erase it from memory, corrupted the Dunamantic fabric holding together time and space itself.

This severely weakened the [[Sirin]], resulting in the failure of the [[First Consummation]] and created a process of the degradation of [[Dunamis]], causing [[Nulmoria]] to begin to seep into the [[Prime Material Plane]], causing all sorts of other cosmological anomalies.

The barrier between the planes became so thin that individuals and eventually whole cities began to pass through into [[Nulmoria]] and vice versa into the [[Prime Material Plane]]. One of the first individuals to pass into the [[Nulmoria]] was [[Alina Baenre]]. Shadow Crossings are rare and therefore its nature is not fully understood.

The [[Everwatchers]] have employed the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] to study this phenomena, which they have intentionally kept highly secretive. The reason for this is that they discovered the use and practice of magic has gradually been degrading [[Dunamis]] further and resulting in more frequent Shadow Crossings with every major war or conflict.

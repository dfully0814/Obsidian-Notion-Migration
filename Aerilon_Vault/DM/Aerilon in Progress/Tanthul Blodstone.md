# Significance
The [[Netherese]] mages of [[Thultanthar]] were particularly adept at Necromancy beginning with [[Rivalen Tanthul]] passed down to [[Telamont Tanthul]]. At some point in the distance past, the Netherese people of Thultanthar formed an alliance with the Frost Giant tribe in the Netherese war against the [[Phaerimm]].

Tanthul and his mages offered an artifact the giants now call a "blod stone" (blod is giant for "blood") containing the blood of Tanthul himself. [[Jarl Storvald]]'s forefathers received this gift and have passed it down through generations and they were told it would help them find Tanthul's descendants in the event that they ever needed aid. This was part of an ongoing agreement of mutual protection between the two parties. The Netherese also taught the [[Frost Giants]] some about blood magic so that they could create their own stones, which they now inscribe with the runic symbol for blood.

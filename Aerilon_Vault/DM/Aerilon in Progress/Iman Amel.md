# Summary
- Archmage of Cultivation in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]
- He is in charge of training the next generation mages and arcane specialist under the watchful eye of the [[Everwatchers]]
- One of the most distinguishing features of this mage is the magical artifact he carries with him at all times. It is a small, intricately crafted crystal that glows with an otherworldly light. This crystal is attuned to detect the presence of magical abilities in others, allowing the mage to sense the power of those around him. With a mere glance at someone, he can determine whether they possess magical talent or not, giving him a distinct advantage in any situation.
- Despite his power, the mage is calm and collected, always thinking before he acts. He speaks in a deep, resonant voice that commands respect and attention. Though he is often surrounded by other mages seeking his counsel or apprenticeship, he remains aloof and enigmatic, never revealing too much about himself or his past. Yet those who have earned his trust know that he is a kind and wise mentor, always willing to share his knowledge and help those in need.
- Iman's parents were both powerful mages and members of the Arcane Brotherhood, and as a child, he was groomed to follow in their footsteps. He trained in magic from a young age and was sent on expeditions with his parents to acquire rare and powerful magical artifacts for the Brotherhood.
- However, as Iman grew older, he began to have doubts about the Brotherhood's motives and methods. He discovered that some members of the organization were using their power to manipulate and control the Empire from behind the scenes, using their access to rare and powerful artifacts for personal gain rather than to protect the Empire from supernatural threats.
# Motivations
- Has great affection for his students and protects them
- He sees [[Apostates]] as a threat to the arcane community since it brings more hatred and threats and scrutiny down upon them whenever one is discovered.
# Relationships
- Parents where Archmage [[Jahan Amel]] (female) and [[Shahin Amel]] (male)
	- Jahan was known for her expertise in elemental magic, while Shahin was a master of divination and prophecy.

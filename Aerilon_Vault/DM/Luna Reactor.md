![Luna Reactor](https://imgur.com/Ftt4MZF.jpg)

# Significance
- The first "nuclear" reactor created in [[Aerilon]] with the potential to generate more energy than it consumes and provides an efficient draw on the [[Weave]] that appears to allow the [[Weave]] to replace the energy it draws before more is drawn.

# Mechanics
- Like a nuclear reactor, the Luna Reactor use a series of carefully controlled reactions from the chaotic energy drawn from the [[Weave]] to generate heat, which can then be used to generate electricity. The heart of the device is a synthetic crystal developed by [[Dr. Ilian Haley]] he named [[Erythron]], which is imbued with powerful magical properties that allow it to harness and convert the energy of these chaotic reactions, funneling the energy into control rods that are built out of [[Incarnum]] that is capable of storing massive amounts of chaotic energy in perpetuity that then gives off tremendous heat from the rods. The rods are capable of storing excess energy for later use, making the device a reliable and convenient source of power.

# Current Location
- Currently being transported aboard [[The Marianna]], a shipping barge in the shipping fleet of [[Vos Industries]] out in the [[Sea of Swords]] heading into the [[Trackless Sea]] in route to [[Laerkond]] to store it in [[The Retreat]].

The conflict over the Zemari Spring has become a matter of life and death for both the Umaseti and Al-Nurak tribes. Both tribes claim rights to the water source, but their claims and approaches to the conflict are as different as their individualistic and collectivist philosophies.

The Umaseti claim their right to the spring based on their belief in individual achievement and discovery. Farid Al-Din, the current Sheikh, argues that it was one of their own, his great-great-grandfather, who discovered the spring during a time of great drought, effectively saving the lives of both tribes. It is this act of individual heroism and discovery that the Umaseti believe entitles them to the spring.

The Al-Nurak, on the other hand, believe in communal ownership and shared resources. They argue that the spring was a gift from the gods to all the people of the desert, not just the one who happened upon it. They believe that no single tribe should have ownership over a resource so vital to survival.

The conflict itself is fought in skirmishes near the spring and along the borders of their respective territories. The Umaseti, being more individualistic, have each family sending their strongest warriors to fight. Their strategy involves using their superior weaponry, acquired through trade on the Misr al-Ba'id route, to overpower the Al-Nurak warriors.

The Al-Nurak, with their collectivist approach, move and fight as one large, cohesive unit. Everyone, regardless of their role in the tribe, contributes in some way to the war effort, whether it's helping to fortify their village, supporting their warriors, or caring for the wounded.

As for water, both tribes face immense challenges. The Umaseti, being the current controllers of the trade route, have been using their influence and wealth to buy water from passing traders. However, this is a costly solution and one that is not sustainable in the long run.

The Al-Nurak, on the other hand, have sent smaller groups to the spring under the cover of night to collect water. This is a dangerous task as it risks confrontations with the Umaseti. They've also begun digging for new water sources closer to their village, but this is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task with no guarantee of success.

The control of the Misr al-Ba'id route plays a crucial role in this conflict. The Umaseti's control of this trade route has given them a significant advantage in terms of resources, particularly advanced weaponry and imported water. This has undoubtedly escalated the tension between the two tribes, as the Al-Nurak view this as another example of the Umaseti's individualistic philosophy causing harm to the community at large.

# Motivations
# Laws
1.  **Collective Judgement:** For any crime, the elders and other community leaders gather to determine the punishment, considering the context and the collective good.
2.  **Restorative Justice:** The Al-Nurak prioritize repairing the harm caused by criminal behavior. This could involve the criminal apologizing, returning stolen items, or providing some form of service to the victim.
3.  **Community Service:** Often, punishment might involve serving the community in some way, such as manual labor or taking on additional responsibilities.
4.  **Exclusion from Decisions:** Those who commit crimes are often temporarily excluded from participating in community decisions, as a form of social punishment.
5.  **Rehabilitation:** The Al-Nurak believe in helping the offender to avoid future offenses, and they offer guidance and support to help reintegrate them into the society.

# Capital Punishment

The Al-Nurak tribe, being more community-focused, rarely resorts to capital punishment. They believe that every life in the community holds value and every member has a role to play. However, in rare cases where a member has committed a heinous crime such as serial murder or betrayal that led to loss of life and cannot be rehabilitated, capital punishment may be deemed necessary for the greater good of the tribe. The decision is a collective one, taken after much deliberation among the elders and other community leaders. The method of execution is designed to be quick and humane, reflecting the tribe's respect for life even in such circumstances.

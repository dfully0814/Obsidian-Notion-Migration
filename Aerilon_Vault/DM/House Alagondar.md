# Summary
The Alagondar family, like many other Waterdavian noble lineages, made its fortune in trading. Three sisters named Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra Alagondar became famous for sponsoring and then leading adventuring expeditions into Undermountain. One of the items they recovered from the dungeon was a [[tablet of black crystal]] that allowed contact with entities of the [[Far Realm]]. Their brother, [[Xerrion Alagondar]], came to possess the tablet and used it to contact otherworldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family’s business rivals and political enemies. This contact drove Xerrion mad, and it didn’t take long for the madness to spread to other members of the Alagondar family and come into public view. As the family’s behavior grew more bizarre, local broadsheets circulated rumors that the Alagondars had been replaced by aberrant horrors in human guise. Their ancestral villa, Alagondar Hold, was burned to the ground in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR). The Waterdavian authorities who investigated the blaze never made their findings public, but the commonly held belief is that the city’s Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors was responsible.

All three of Xerrion’s sisters were killed in the fire that consumed Alagondar Hold. Xerrion escaped and fled. From there, he used [sending](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/sending) spells to contact Alagondar family members living abroad and brought them to live with him in a twisted, underground version of Alagondar Hold. Among those who answered the call was [[Margaraste Alagondar]], a distant cousin whom Xerrion would later marry.

In the end, Xerrion and Margaraste stepped through a gateway into the [[Far Realm]] and were never seen again. In their absence, the torch of leadership passed to Xerrion’s niece and nephew, [[Dezmyr Alagondar]] and [[Zalthar Alagondar]] — the twin children of his late sister [[Yarlithra Alagondar]]. These former paladins of [[Helm]] abandoned their faith long ago, becoming death knights.

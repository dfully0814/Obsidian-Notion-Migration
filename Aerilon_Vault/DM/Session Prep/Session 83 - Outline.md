# Secrets 
- [ ] There is no time dimension in [[Elall]] so the [[Githzerai]] often travel outside the space to raise families, which they learned the concept of from the [[Netherese]].
- [ ] Wanting to venture beyond [[Elall]] is what sparked the civil war between [[Githyanki]] and [[Githzerai]]
- [ ] The [[Anarchs]] are crucial for the survival of their people because they can create large citiy-sized temporal spaces from others' memories that [[Elall]] will feed upon instead of consuming them.
- [ ] Travel to [[Elall]] can be done mentally or physically but only the most powerful Anarchs travel mentally due to the danger of being consumed by [[Elall]]
- [ ] [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] wants to get the [[Sirin Beacons]] in order to prolong his life
- [ ] [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]] seeks to save her people from [[Nulmoria]] by using one of the [[Sirin Beacons]] to create a [[Singularity]] and bring them into the [[Prime Material Plane]]

As he trains Teymir, he begins to allow [[Elall]] through more and more to force Teymir to face it. This will normally come in fits of strong memories. He trains Teymir to steel his mind and block out emotion, particularly his emotions tied to his memories or lack thereof. 
 - [[Master Aegith Rane]] speaking to Teymir giving him a pep talk to do something it seems like he doesn't want to do. "O, Teymir. It's doing the hardest things that make us the strongest. The bravest among men are the ones willing to do what no one else will. And you are brave. Your heart is a fire. We are who we are because it is our responsibility to stick our hands down in the very filth of the world if necessary to expunge it so that the common man need not even have the knowledge that there ever was a danger. We sacrifice for the peace of everyone else."

# Secrets 
- [ ] [[Auril]] and [[Arharzel]] were left behind after the gods locked themselves behind the [[Divine Gate]] and took human form to conceal their identities. Devoid of divine power, they took on more human attributes and fell in love.
	- [ ] [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]] is the human form of [[Auril]]
	- [ ] [[Rivalen Tanthul]] is the human form of [[Arharzel]]
- [ ] Only the [[Sirin]] can create dragons. Since they are locked away, [[Auril]] is attempting to use [[Chardalyn]] to create new children from humans since she can't have any of her own.
		- [ ] She seeks to use the [[Sirin Beacons]] to enter the [[Prime Material Plane]], take revenge on [[Arharzel]] and establish dragons back to their rightful place of power over everything now that the gods have left a power gap.
		- [ ] Seeing his potential in the caverns, she has begun recruiting [[Yang Tieh]] through appearing to him using the memories of [[Leowin Moonflower]] in order to power his spear, a [[vestige]] from the [[Calamity]] times known as the [[Arc Infinitus]]. 
	- [ ] The [[Everwatchers]] empire was born from a cult named the [[Ezrella]] who formed after the events of [[Karsus' Folly]] and were dedicated to keeping the ways of [[Netheril Empire]] dead and buried.
	- [ ] [[Teymir]]' s brother and sister are [[Telta Baenre]] and [[Ithrel Baenre]].
	- [ ] [[Teymir]]'s real name is [[Ildan Baenre]]
	- [ ] [[Chardalyn]] is [[Incarnum]] that has been infused with the necrotic energy of [[Nulmoria]], greatly increasing its necrotic power and any other magic that interacts with that necrotic power
	- [ ] [[The Moonstone Mask]] contains defensive mechanisms if someone tries to steal anything from any of the glass cases. An alarm spell is currently active inside each of the glass cases. If an appendage passes into the inside space of the cases, the alarm will trigger, metal sheets will drop down over the front and back doors and oxygen will begin to be sucked from the room. There is also a persistent anti-magic field in the room preventing teleportation and other arcane devices.

# Scenes
- [x] Entering [[Neverwinter]]
	- The party will enter from the south gate near the [[Protector's Enclave]]. There will be four [[Everwatch Knights]], two [[Everwatcher Nullifer]](s) guarding the gate, and one [[Arcane Brotherhood]] acolyte guarding the gate. Acolytes don't have the ability to immediately detect magic adepts like [[Arcane Brotherhood Inquisitors]] and above do. The acolytes use a glowing orange orb to cast detect magic that can tell if someone is a magic user or not. [[Galladon]] will give [[Elleanna Corvus]] something that can negate it but can only be used twice.
- [ ] [[Ophala Marget]] tells [[Sighi Thorgison]] that [[Teymir]] is there if she finds out. 
- [ ] Gambling games in [[The Moonstone Mask]]
	-  **#1 Hand of Fate**  
		**Suggested buy-in**: 50 gold pieces
		Played similarly to Texas Hold ’em casino poker, this DND gambling game has its own flop, turn, and river. The premise of **Hand of Fate** is very simple. Each participating player pays 50 GP to join the pot, although bets may be adjusted based on group preferences.
		
		Then, a player rolls 1d12 die and keeps it secret from his or her fellow players. Each player can then choose to fold and forfeit their bet, call the bet or raise the bet if they feel confident in their roll. After that, a d12 die is rolled that becomes a community dice that everyone can see.
		
		After the roll, players can again call, raise or fold their bets as they see fit. Once this round is finished, another d12 die is rolled, so players now have two community dice. This is the part where players have a final chance to adjust their bets before they have to reveal their own dice.
		
		The winning condition is simple. The player with the highest combined value of his or her own die and the community dice wins 80% of the pot, and the other 20% is contributed to the casino.

	- **#2 Twenty-One**
		**Suggested buy-in**: 25 gold pieces
		Another great addition to the possible DND minigames you can try, **Twenty-one**, is modeled after another real-world popular option, blackjack. In fact, the original name of blackjack was Twenty-one, only in French. It was later changed to blackjack in the United States.
		
		In any event, the basic mechanic of the game applies nicely to dice gameplay. Here is how it works in Dungeons and Dragons. A player will roll 2d10 dice. The dealer will do the same, but only if the dice will be publicly revealed. 
		
		Players and the dealer then have the option to roll as many additional dice as they see fit. However, there is a catch. You cannot exceed 21 as the sum total of your dice, or you lose the game automatically. 
		
		If a dealer rolls a natural 21 from the start, the player(s) loses. If a player rolls 21, the dealer loses. In the case of ties, the winnings are split. Note that all die sides keep their face value except for the 1, which will be treated as both 1 and 11, depending on what you need at the moment of your roll. 
		
		If both you and the dealer have 21, you get a 1:1 payout from your bet. If your roll places you over 21, you bust, and your bets are immediately forfeited. Players win all other bets at a payout of 3:2.

# Locations
- [[Neverwinter]]
	- [[The Moonstone Mask]]

# Enemies
- [[Everwatcher Nullifer]]
	- When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
	- The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.
	- _**Reversal.**_ When a creature the reverser can see within 30 feet of it regains hit points, the reverser reduces the number of hit points regained to 0, and the reverser deals 13 (3d8) force damage to the creature.
	- Uses **Aeroian Absorber** stat block

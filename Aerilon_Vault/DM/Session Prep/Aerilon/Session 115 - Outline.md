- [ ] The [[Eye of the Ancients]] is another [[Arc Infinitus]] that [[Arthund Jamas]] found for the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]
- [ ] The city of [[Luskan]] is celebrating the [[Sea Maiden's Faire Festival]], which is a festival after which the theater troupe is named. 
- [ ] [[Arthund Jamas]] is trying to seek magical means to help [[Mera Jamas]] covertly behind the back of the [[Everwatchers]]
- [ ] The city of [[Luskan]] was one of the first cities taken by the [[Ezrella]] after their rise to power following [[Karsus' Folly]]
- [ ] [[Mera Jamas]] is suffering from [[Timeline Displacement]]
	- At various points she will think she is the wife of [[Kwalish Tanthul]], [[Rillan Tanthul]], calling out for "Kwalish" and "Derkas".  See other symptoms
- [ ] [[Lord Dagult Silverhand]] is secretly a member of the [[Wyrmspeakers]]

- [ ] [[Tharizdun]] is not a separate entity but a manifestation of when the [[Sirin]] severed its own body when it saw the same proclivity toward chaos in itself that manifested in its creation of the [[Primordials]]. It believed that time is the enemy of order and purpose, brining only increasing levels of chaos as time goes on. So it cut off its own memory of itself and its purpose in order to end the passage of time.
> 		Memory and time transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.
# Scenes
- Entering [[Luskan]]
	*As you approach the city of Luskan, the salty sea breeze becomes more pungent with the smell of fish and brine. The clamor of seagulls and the creaking of ships' masts fill the air, mingling with the sound of sailors shouting and merchants haggling over prices. You see bustling docks lined with warehouses and fishing boats unloading their catch, while large ships come and go from the harbor, their sails flapping in the wind. The streets are crowded with people of all races and backgrounds.
	You notice the architecture is varied, reflecting the city's long history of conquest and rebuilding. Some buildings are made of wood and thatch, while others are crafted from stone and adorned with ornate carvings. The streets are lined with shops and stalls selling goods of all kinds, from fresh produce to exotic spices and rare books. You can hear the sounds of blacksmiths hammering away at their forges, while the sweet aroma of freshly baked bread drifts from nearby bakeries.
	Despite the hustle and bustle of the city, there is an undercurrent of danger and intrigue. You catch glimpses of cloaked figures and shady characters lurking in the shadows of alleyways, and can feel the weight of their gaze upon you. You see fortified walls and watchtowers around the city, a testament to the constant threat of invasion from rival cities and raiders. You see Everwatch Knights patrolling the streets, fully armed.
	The Host Tower of the Arcane looms over the city, a massive black spire that houses powerful wizards and sorcerers from the Arcane Brotherhood. The Cutlass, a notorious tavern known for its raucous atmosphere and shady clientele, beckons you in with the sound of laughter and clinking tankards. The market square is a riot of colors and smells.
	The streets are dimly lit by torches and lanterns, casting flickering shadows on the buildings and alleys.
	As you approach the city, you begin to hear music growing ever louder, and you are immediately struck by the vibrant energy in the air. The streets are alive with people dressed in brightly colored clothing, laughing and chatting with one another. The smell of savory seafood wafts through the air, tempting your taste buds. The sound of music and singing can be heard from every corner. You see evidence of some sort of festival that has transformed Luskan into a wondrous sea of colors and light. The harbor is filled with boats and ships decorated with flags and banners, bobbing on the water's surface. The waves are tumultuous, crashing against the stone walls of the harbor and the ships anchored there. 
	In the town square, a large stage has been set up, where musicians and performers are putting on a dazzling show for the crowds. Dancers move in time to the music, their colorful dresses and flowing scarves adding to the spectacle. Magicians and acrobats perform feats of incredible skill and daring, drawing gasps and cheers from the audience.
	Every street and alley is decorated with colorful banners, streamers, and lanterns. The city's many shops and market stalls are bustling with activity, selling a wide variety of goods, from fresh seafood to handcrafted jewelry and trinkets.
	The festival reaches its climax. The streets are illuminated by hundreds of lanterns glowing a bright blue, almost white that begin to rise into the sky, coalescing together and forming an image of two large waves touching and then crashing opposite one another. Fireworks then begin to light up the sky, casting a kaleidoscope of colors over the city, leaving behind shapes of animals and other symbols, one of which you recognize as the snowflake symbol of Auril. The crowds cheer and applaud, their faces alight with joy and wonder.* 

- [[Day of Wonders]] Parade
	- [[Day of Wonders Parade Description]]
- Encountering [[Iman Amel]]
	- [[Iman Amel]] is headquartered in the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]] and occasionally makes trips to [[Waterdeep]] to confer with the [[Everwatchers]] and other brotherhood members for important business.
	- He will be at the end of the [[Sea Maiden's Faire]] parade that the players will ``witness with an entourage. 
	- Description of him coming in the parade
		- *At the end of the procession is a older man with well-groomed white hair and beard, Persian descent, with a decadent royal blue rob trimmed in gold. He wears a glowing blue pendant around his neck thrumming with light. His eyes emit a similar glowing light as he seems to CAREFULLY SCAN the excited crowd as he begins to pass. Surrounding him are a group of young mages all in their late teens, both male and female. They are throwing up their hands, emitting sparks and fireworks, some creating abstract shapes, others forming into animals or dancing humanoid figures and waving to the crowd.* 
		- At this point, if [[Elleanna Corvus]] or [[Asad Al-Nuri]] don't run to hide in a building that has walls at least 1 inch thick with stone, [[Iman Amel]] will be able to see that they are adept with magic. If he sees [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] together, he will mostly focus on [[Elleanna Corvus]], being able to tell that the same energy surrounding the [[Eye of the Ancients]] is coming from her. If he just sees [[Asad Al-Nuri]], he will be apprehended immediately. 
- The [[Blessing of the Fleet]]
	*As you stand on the waterfront, the sun begins to dip towards the horizon, casting a warm golden light across the harbor of Luskan. The air is thick with the smells of saltwater and fresh seafood, and the sound of seagulls fills your ears.

	*As the time for the Blessing of the Fleet approaches, a hush falls over the crowd. You can see several ships, each one adorned with brightly colored banners and flags, making their way towards the center of the harbor. They come from all different directions, but they all seem to be moving with purpose, as if drawn by some invisible force.
	
	*As the ships gather, you notice a group of clerics and priests, their robes billowing in the sea breeze, making their way to the edge of the dock. They are carrying censers filled with incense, and you can see the smoke curling upwards towards the sky.
	
	*The crowd falls silent as the lead cleric steps forward and raises his arms towards the sky. He begins to chant a prayer, his voice carrying across the water, asking for the blessings of the sea and the winds upon the ships and their crews. The other priests join in, their voices blending together in a harmonious chorus.
	
	*As the prayers reach their climax, the clerics begin to move towards the edge of the dock, and you see them throwing handfuls of rose petals and other flowers into the water. They are followed by the crews of the ships, who toss in small offerings of their own, such as coins or bits of ribbon.
	
	*Suddenly, the sound of horns and trumpets fills the air, and you see the ships beginning to move, one by one, towards the open sea. As they pass by the dock, the crews wave to the crowd, shouting greetings and well-wishes. Some even toss small gifts or trinkets into the hands of the onlookers.
	
	*As the ships disappear into the distance, you feel a sense of awe and reverence, as if you have witnessed something ancient and powerful. You realize that the Blessing of the Fleet is not just a celebration of the sea, but a reminder of the deep connections between humans and the natural world, and the importance of respecting and honoring the forces that sustain us.

- [[Everwatcher Nullifer]]
	- When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
	- The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spellâs level. On a success, the creatureâs spell fails and has no effect.
	- _**Reversal.**_ When a creature the reverser can see within 30 feet of it regains hit points, the reverser reduces the number of hit points regained to 0, and the reverser deals 13 (3d8) force damage to the creature.

- Thermodynamic Asymmetry in Time
	- https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-thermo/
	- The science of thermodynamics is able to capture these generalizations as consequences of its claim that systems spontaneously evolve to future equilibrium states ==but do not spontaneously evolve away from equilibrium states==.
- https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/
	- ==While not following Augustine all the way to the mind-dependence of other times, we can concede that the perception of temporal duration is crucially bound up with memory.==
	- 
- Research on Yin and Yang
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#Nature
	- InÂ [Daoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoism "Daoism")Â philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in theÂ _[Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching "Tao Te Ching")_Â at chapter 42.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#cite_note-21)Â  It becomes sensible from an initialÂ [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence")Â or emptiness ([wuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)"), sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving untilÂ [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence")Â is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more.
	- Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the skyâan intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.
	- Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.
	- ==This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao==, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.
- Dualism in cosmology
	- Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the godsÂ [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity) "Set (deity)")Â (disorder, death) andÂ [Osiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris "Osiris")Â (order, life).
	- The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion ofÂ [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism")Â around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes thatÂ [Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda "Ahura Mazda")Â is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise fromÂ _[druj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha "Asha")_, which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and giveÂ _druj_Â power.
- Tao/Dao
	- In most belief systems, the word is used symbolically in its sense of "way" as the right or proper way of existence, or in the context of ongoing practices of attainment or of the full coming into being, or the state ofÂ [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual) "Enlightenment (spiritual)")Â or spiritual perfection that is the outcome of such practices.
	- The Tao can be roughly thought of as theÂ _flow of the Universe_Â or as some essence or pattern behind the natural world that keeps the Universe balanced and ordered.
	- The Tao is more commonly expressed in the relationship betweenÂ _[wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative) "Mu (negative)")_Â (void or emptiness, in the sense ofÂ [_wuji_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)")) andÂ _[yinyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinyang "Yinyang")_Â (the natural, dynamic balance between opposites), leading to its central principle ofÂ _[wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")_Â (inaction or inexertion).
	- The Tao is usually described in terms of elements of nature, and in particular as similar to water. Like water it is undifferentiated, endlessly self-replenishing, soft and quiet but immensely powerful, and impassively generous.
	- Much of Taoist philosophy centers on the cyclical continuity of the natural world and its contrast to the linear, goal-oriented actions of human beings.
	- The Tao was shared with Confucianism,Â [ChÃ¡n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Ch%C3%A1n "Chinese ChÃ¡n")Â andÂ [Zen Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen "Zen"), and more broadly throughout East Asian philosophy and religion in general. In Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, and Confucianism, the object of spiritual practice is to "become one with the Tao" (_Tao Te Ching_) or to harmonize one's will with Nature (cf.Â [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism")) to achieve "effortless action" (_[wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")_).
	- The Tao is intrinsically related to the conceptsÂ [yin and yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang "Yin and yang")Â ([pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"):Â [_yÄ«nyÃ¡ng_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/y%C4%ABny%C3%A1ng "wikt:yÄ«nyÃ¡ng")), where every action creates counter-actions as unavoidable movements within manifestations of the Tao, and proper practice variously involves accepting, conforming to, or working with these natural developments.
	- When we think that lifeâs occurrences seem unfair (a human discrimination), we should remember that heavenâs (_tian_) net misses nothing, it leaves nothing undone (ch. 37)+0

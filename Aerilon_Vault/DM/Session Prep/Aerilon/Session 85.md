## [[Teymir]] Vision of Killing His Parents
song: https://open.spotify.com/track/3nWcjWALonQpDBsyRP5725?si=e7eaa7ee4209462c
Begins with his face pressed into soft material, everything is black, and he hears a comforting voice. 

[[Master Aegith Rane]] speaking to Teymir giving him a pep talk to do something it seems like he doesn't want to do. "O, Teymir. I'm so proud of you. It's doing the hardest things that make us the strongest. The bravest among men are the ones willing to do what no one else will. And you are brave. Your heart is a fire. We are who we are because it is our responsibility to stick our hands down in the very filth of the world if necessary to expunge it so that the common man need not even have the knowledge that there ever was a danger. We sacrifice for the peace of everyone else. Find strength in your heart, my boy. The children of Aerilon will sleep soundly in their beds tonight and it's all thanks to you."

*You then catch the smell of smoke, warmth all around you. Your eyes open and look over where you see the burned and disfigured forms of two abnormally large humanoid figures lying in an oversized bed. The walls, the floor, hanging pictures, knick-nacks, and the ceiling smoldering with a radiant glow like fire.* as the vision ends

	- Say they both may be a pawn in Galladon's plan 
	- Teymir, "I was there for 5 years and I missed you. I missed our friendship. "
	- Discuss if Fennis can be trusted
	- "Ell I need you to not be threatened by Fennis. He matters to me. And I hope that I can restore what friendship we had before but its tangential to my friendship with you, Ell. I follow my instincts and those have kept me alive this long. And they're not always right. But I'm not about to stop doing it. And my instincts tell me to trust you even though you're not trustworthy and I don't know what that means. You're stuck in something I probably don't have all the details for and which you have your own motivation to escape. But I need you to know that my friendship with you means that my back is exposed to you."
		- Ell reaction of fear, guilt, apprehension realizing Teymir is vulnerable with her and she could take advantage. "Thank you for being my friend, Teymir. I haven't had one since my father left. All of you have been kinder to me than I deserve."

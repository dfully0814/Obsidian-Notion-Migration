So it cut off its own memory of itself and its purpose in order to end the passage of time.
> 		Memory and time transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall.

# Scenes
- [ ] Attack on the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]]
	- Attackers - Eldritch Assassin, Frost Giant Champion, Frost Giant Frostmaiden, Red Wizard

		- The red wizard has 5 legendary actions

	- Battle scene description
> 		The snow-covered battlefield is filled with chaos and destruction as what appear to be a group of frost giants launch a surprise attack on your unsuspecting party and a large number of Everwatch Knights. The giants tower over knights in the distance who have apparently already quickly exited the train to head off these hulking figures, whose icy skin glints in dim light of the day as dusk approaches, their eyes filled with a cold, merciless intent. They wield their massive battle axes with deadly precision, chopping through armor and flesh with ease as you see one knight after the other begin to fall.
> 
> 		The soldiers, caught off guard, struggle to defend themselves against the giants' onslaught. Some soldiers in the groups whirl their swords sending blasts of energy out of the blades as others begin firing orbs of energy from their hands to slow the giants down.
> 
> 		Cries of war-fueled rage fills the air on both sides. The snow around you is already stained red with blood, and the ground is littered with the bodies of those who have already fallen. The giants' faces are savagely twisted as they seem to revel in the slaughter unfolding.
> 
> 		It's a fight for survival, as the soldiers desperately try to hold off the giants and protect themselves from the cold and the giants seem bent on full scale destruction.

- [Displacer Render](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/3033433-displacer-render)
- [[Everwatcher Nullifer]]
	- When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
	- The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spellâs level. On a success, the creatureâs spell fails and has no effect.
	- _**Reversal.**_ When a creature the reverser can see within 30 feet of it regains hit points, the reverser reduces the number of hit points regained to 0, and the reverser deals 13 (3d8) force damage to the creature.

- Thermodynamic Asymmetry in Time
	- https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-thermo/
	- The science of thermodynamics is able to capture these generalizations as consequences of its claim that systems spontaneously evolve to future equilibrium states ==but do not spontaneously evolve away from equilibrium states==.
- https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time-experience/
	- ==While not following Augustine all the way to the mind-dependence of other times, we can concede that the perception of temporal duration is crucially bound up with memory.==
	- 
- Research on Yin and Yang
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#Nature
	- InÂ [Daoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoism "Daoism")Â philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in theÂ _[Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching "Tao Te Ching")_Â at chapter 42.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#cite_note-21)Â  It becomes sensible from an initialÂ [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence")Â or emptiness ([wuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)"), sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving untilÂ [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence")Â is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more.
	- Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the skyâan intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.
	- Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.
	- ==This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao==, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.
- Dualism in cosmology
	- Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the godsÂ [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity) "Set (deity)")Â (disorder, death) andÂ [Osiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris "Osiris")Â (order, life).
	- The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion ofÂ [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism")Â around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes thatÂ [Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda "Ahura Mazda")Â is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise fromÂ _[druj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha "Asha")_, which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and giveÂ _druj_Â power.
- Tao/Dao
	- In most belief systems, the word is used symbolically in its sense of "way" as the right or proper way of existence, or in the context of ongoing practices of attainment or of the full coming into being, or the state ofÂ [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual) "Enlightenment (spiritual)")Â or spiritual perfection that is the outcome of such practices.
	- The Tao can be roughly thought of as theÂ _flow of the Universe_Â or as some essence or pattern behind the natural world that keeps the Universe balanced and ordered.
	- The Tao is more commonly expressed in the relationship betweenÂ _[wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative) "Mu (negative)")_Â (void or emptiness, in the sense ofÂ [_wuji_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)")) andÂ _[yinyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinyang "Yinyang")_Â (the natural, dynamic balance between opposites), leading to its central principle ofÂ _[wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")_Â (inaction or inexertion).
	- The Tao is usually described in terms of elements of nature, and in particular as similar to water. Like water it is undifferentiated, endlessly self-replenishing, soft and quiet but immensely powerful, and impassively generous.
	- Much of Taoist philosophy centers on the cyclical continuity of the natural world and its contrast to the linear, goal-oriented actions of human beings.
	- The Tao was shared with Confucianism,Â [ChÃ¡n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Ch%C3%A1n "Chinese ChÃ¡n")Â andÂ [Zen Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen "Zen"), and more broadly throughout East Asian philosophy and religion in general. In Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, and Confucianism, the object of spiritual practice is to "become one with the Tao" (_Tao Te Ching_) or to harmonize one's will with Nature (cf.Â [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism")) to achieve "effortless action" (_[wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")_).
	- The Tao is intrinsically related to the conceptsÂ [yin and yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang "Yin and yang")Â ([pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"):Â [_yÄ«nyÃ¡ng_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/y%C4%ABny%C3%A1ng "wikt:yÄ«nyÃ¡ng")), where every action creates counter-actions as unavoidable movements within manifestations of the Tao, and proper practice variously involves accepting, conforming to, or working with these natural developments.
	- When we think that lifeâs occurrences seem unfair (a human discrimination), we should remember that heavenâs (_tian_) net misses nothing, it leaves nothing undone (ch. 37)

- Instead of summoning a demon with her 1/day ability she summons a winged shade from MM expanded. 
- After first round, the female Drow chained to the wall will start shouting for help in Undercommon. Whoever frees her she will give advantage on Intelligence saving throws. She has the stat block of a **Drow Shadowblade**.

	- 

### Actions
- She can spend an action to summon three shadows.

### Legendary actions
- She has 3 legendary actions and legendary resistance
	-  *Shadow teleport.* The inquisitor can teleport from one area of dim light or darkness to another area of dim light or darkness.
	- *Shadow summon.* Inquisitor summons one shadow per action.
	- *Attack.* She makes one attack with her death lance
	- *Shade attack.* Allied shade within 30 ft uses its reaction to make one attack against a target of her choice that she can see
	- *Cast Spell.* The drow expends a spell slot to cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell that she has prepared. Doing so costs 1 legendary action per level of the spell. **Darkness** counts here too.
	- *Consume Shadow.* 
		- For every shadow currently on the battle field, the Inquisitor heals 10d4+8 hit points.
		- She could also just use this in order to use *Expel Shadow*. She doesn't need to heal first.
	- *Expel shadow* (3 actions)
		- The Inquisitor releases a **psychic** blast containing the painful emotions of the souls that she's trapped. She deals a total amount of **psychic** damage that she has acquired through healing using *Consume Shadow*.
		- A creature must make a DC 18 intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes the full amount of psychic damage and is stunned for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
			- On a success, the creature is not stunned, and takes half the amount of psychic damage.

### Lair actions
She can use one of the following actions on initiative count 20 (losing ties):

- *Shadow tentacles.* (action)
	- The Drow creates a 40ft radius circle on the ground from which dark tentacles of shadow emerges and covers the ground. When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC 18) or take 4d6 necrotic damage and be [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by the tentacles until the spell ends.
	- A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by the tentacles takes 4d6 necrotic damage and its HP maximum is reduced by the amount of damage taken.
- *Shadow spawns* (auto)
	- Every round on initiative count 20, 3 shadows spawn (add +2 per round)
- *Shadow assassin.* Inquisitor can consume four shadows to form a Shadow Assassin.

## Debrief with [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]
## The First Singularity
At some point, either during the fight with the inquisitor or afterward, [[Teymir]] will begin to hear the voice of [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], as he will begin to see the area around him start to dissolve back and forth into the underground cave area of the lighthouse where he'll first see large cages with people in them. then a row of people on their needs next to a tall women in black with a large black headdress. He will see a large black orb in the center of the room pulsating with a bright purple glow while the figures in the scene move but he doesn't seem able to interact with them. He will see a group of Drow guards hand cuffing and chaining John Smith and putting him in a cage they will raise into the air. He will see Leowin being brought in and made to grab the orb that will appear to sap her of her strength and be powered up by her.

If the [[Singularity]] completes, an area of [[Nulmoria]] around [[Thornhold]] will be brought into the [[Prime Material Plane]] permanently and a Core Spawn Worm will break through.

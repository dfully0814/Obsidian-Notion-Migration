- [ ] Wanting to venture beyond [[Elall]] is what sparked the civil war between [[Githyanki]] and [[Githzerai]].

## Opening Scene with Teymir
https://i.imgur.com/Hg02cbh.jpg

*Teymir, you open your eyes to see a familiar coastline. You hear the soothing sounds of ships readying to sail, the shout of gruff and tumbled deck hands at one another--the smell of fresh fish on the air. It appears to be dusk, there's a lit fire in front of you with what appears to be an animal impaled and hanging over the fire. In the distance, to the south down the coastline you see Waterdeep's Dock Ward--the only home you've ever known. Ships appear to be going and coming and the city appears to be bustling. Next to the fire, you see a discolored, time-worn brown wide-brimmed hat.*

As Teymir begins to walk around, the further away he goes from Waterdeep, the more reality around him will start to show its cracks. He will soon meet [[Dak Grella]] coming back from hunting a wolf.

After conversing about the immediate events and possibly sharing some of his secrets, a long period of time will pass in which Teymir will tell me what he does. If he tries to escape, he will not be able. Dak will tell him some about [[Elall]] and the need for mental protection.

Dak has grown fond of the people in [[Toril]] since he has been visiting occasionally and had his son [[Zera]] here. He wants to keep the people of [[Toril]] from being helpless in facing [[Elall]] by training someone who can handle it and he thinks Teymir can. 

As he trains Teymir, he begins to allow [[Elall]] through more and more to force Teymir to face it. This will normally come in fits of strong memories.

Examples of some memories he will experience:

- Playing on [[Evermeet]] with a vibrant yellow and orange bird that he chases into the forest. Dark-skinned Drow children run up behind him and shout, "Ildan! Where's Rushnaa??!!"
 - Teymir being lead in manacles that vibrant with energy by the [[Everwatchers]] into the [[Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. As he is lead off the ship, he catches the eye of a bald, gray-skinned man who seems to be interacting with an old merchant with all sorts of strange looking artifacts on a cart.
 - [[Master Aegith Rane]] speaking to Teymir giving him a pep talk to do something it seems like he doesn't want to do. "O, Teymir. It's doing the hardest things that make us the strongest. The bravest among men are the ones willing to do what no one else will. And you are brave. Your heart is a fire. We are who we are because it is our responsibility to stick our hands down in the very filth of the world if necessary to expunge it so that the common man need not even have the knowledge that there ever was a danger. We sacrifice for the peace of everyone else."

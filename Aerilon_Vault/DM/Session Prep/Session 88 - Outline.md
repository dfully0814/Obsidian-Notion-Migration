# Scenes
## The Story of Auril in the Citadel

> [!Capture of the Wyrmspeakers]
> In the center of the room is a large dyorama. All the statues appear made of onyx. It depicts a scene with what appears to be the form of Matron Lyrala Xorlarrin leading a group of five robed and hooded humanoid figures across rocky crags all bound together in chains.

## The First Singularity
At some point, either during the fight with the inquisitor or afterward, [[Teymir]] will begin to hear the voice of [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], as he will begin to see the area around him start to dissolve back and forth into the underground cave area of the lighthouse where he'll first see large cages with people in them. then a row of people on their needs next to a tall women in black with a large black headdress. He will see a large black orb in the center of the room pulsating with a bright purple glow while the figures in the scene move but he doesn't seem able to interact with them. He will see a group of Drow guards hand cuffing and chaining John Smith and putting him in a cage they will raise into the air. He will see Leowin being brought in and made to grab the orb that will appear to sap her of her strength and be powered up by her.

If the [[Singularity]] completes, an area of [[Nulmoria]] around [[Thornhold]] will be brought into the [[Prime Material Plane]] permanently and a Core Spawn Worm will break through.

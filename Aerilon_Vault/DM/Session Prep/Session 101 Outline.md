- [ ] Completing [[Sighi Thorgison]]'s job
- [ ] Gambling games in [[The Moonstone Mask]]
	-  **#1 Hand of Fate**  
		**Suggested buy-in**: 50 gold pieces
		Played similarly to Texas Hold ’em casino poker, this DND gambling game has its own flop, turn, and river. The premise of **Hand of Fate** is very simple. Each participating player pays 50 GP to join the pot, although bets may be adjusted based on group preferences.
		
		Then, a player rolls 1d12 die and keeps it secret from his or her fellow players. Each player can then choose to fold and forfeit their bet, call the bet or raise the bet if they feel confident in their roll. After that, a d12 die is rolled that becomes a community dice that everyone can see.
		
		After the roll, players can again call, raise or fold their bets as they see fit. Once this round is finished, another d12 die is rolled, so players now have two community dice. This is the part where players have a final chance to adjust their bets before they have to reveal their own dice.
		
		The winning condition is simple. The player with the highest combined value of his or her own die and the community dice wins 80% of the pot, and the other 20% is contributed to the casino.

	- **#2 Twenty-One**
		**Suggested buy-in**: 25 gold pieces
		Another great addition to the possible DND minigames you can try, **Twenty-one**, is modeled after another real-world popular option, blackjack. In fact, the original name of blackjack was Twenty-one, only in French. It was later changed to blackjack in the United States.
		
		In any event, the basic mechanic of the game applies nicely to dice gameplay. Here is how it works in Dungeons and Dragons. A player will roll 2d10 dice. The dealer will do the same, but only if the dice will be publicly revealed. 
		
		Players and the dealer then have the option to roll as many additional dice as they see fit. However, there is a catch. You cannot exceed 21 as the sum total of your dice, or you lose the game automatically. 
		
		If a dealer rolls a natural 21 from the start, the player(s) loses. If a player rolls 21, the dealer loses. In the case of ties, the winnings are split. Note that all die sides keep their face value except for the 1, which will be treated as both 1 and 11, depending on what you need at the moment of your roll. 
		
		If both you and the dealer have 21, you get a 1:1 payout from your bet. If your roll places you over 21, you bust, and your bets are immediately forfeited. Players win all other bets at a payout of 3:2.

	- When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
	- The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.
	- _**Reversal.**_ When a creature the reverser can see within 30 feet of it regains hit points, the reverser reduces the number of hit points regained to 0, and the reverser deals 13 (3d8) force damage to the creature.

# Notes
- Scifi stuff: https://www.dmsguild.com/product/258895/Spaceships-and-Starwyrms-Core-Sourcebook
- Think about assembling the [Orrery of the Wanderer](https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/705876-orrery-of-the-wanderer) in order to travel to the [[Transitory Plane]]
- Research on Yin and Yang
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#Nature
	- In [Daoist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daoism "Daoism") philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the _[Tao Te Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tao_Te_Ching "Tao Te Ching")_ at chapter 42.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang#cite_note-21)  It becomes sensible from an initial [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence") or emptiness ([wuji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)"), sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [quiescence](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quiescence "wikt:quiescence") is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more.
	- Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky—an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.
	- Contrast is needed to create a distinguishable reality, without which we would experience nothingness. Therefore, the independent principles of yin and yang are actually dependent on one another for each other's distinguishable existence.
	- ==This is because all opposites are manifestations of the single Tao==, and are therefore not independent from one another, but rather a variation of the same unifying force throughout all of nature.
- Dualism in cosmology
	- Moral dualism began as a theological belief. Dualism was first seen implicitly in Egyptian religious beliefs by the contrast of the gods [Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity) "Set (deity)") (disorder, death) and [Osiris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris "Osiris") (order, life).
	- The first explicit conception of dualism came from the Ancient Persian religion of [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism") around the mid-fifth century BC. Zoroastrianism is a monotheistic religion that believes that [Ahura Mazda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahura_Mazda "Ahura Mazda") is the eternal creator of all good things. Any violations of Ahura Mazda's order arise from _[druj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asha "Asha")_, which is everything uncreated. From this comes a significant choice for humans to make. Either they fully participate in human life for Ahura Mazda or they do not and give _druj_ power.
- Tao/Dao
	- In most belief systems, the word is used symbolically in its sense of "way" as the right or proper way of existence, or in the context of ongoing practices of attainment or of the full coming into being, or the state of [enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enlightenment_(spiritual) "Enlightenment (spiritual)") or spiritual perfection that is the outcome of such practices.
	- The Tao can be roughly thought of as the _flow of the Universe_ or as some essence or pattern behind the natural world that keeps the Universe balanced and ordered.
	- The Tao is more commonly expressed in the relationship between _[wu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mu_(negative) "Mu (negative)")_ (void or emptiness, in the sense of [_wuji_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuji_(philosophy) "Wuji (philosophy)")) and _[yinyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yinyang "Yinyang")_ (the natural, dynamic balance between opposites), leading to its central principle of _[wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")_ (inaction or inexertion).
	- The Tao is usually described in terms of elements of nature, and in particular as similar to water. Like water it is undifferentiated, endlessly self-replenishing, soft and quiet but immensely powerful, and impassively generous.
	- Much of Taoist philosophy centers on the cyclical continuity of the natural world and its contrast to the linear, goal-oriented actions of human beings.
	- The Tao was shared with Confucianism, [Chán](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Ch%C3%A1n "Chinese Chán") and [Zen Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen "Zen"), and more broadly throughout East Asian philosophy and religion in general. In Taoism, Chinese Buddhism, and Confucianism, the object of spiritual practice is to "become one with the Tao" (_Tao Te Ching_) or to harmonize one's will with Nature (cf. [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism "Stoicism")) to achieve "effortless action" (_[wu wei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei "Wu wei")_).
	- The Tao is intrinsically related to the concepts [yin and yang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yin_and_yang "Yin and yang") ([pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin "Pinyin"): [_yīnyáng_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/y%C4%ABny%C3%A1ng "wikt:yīnyáng")), where every action creates counter-actions as unavoidable movements within manifestations of the Tao, and proper practice variously involves accepting, conforming to, or working with these natural developments.
	- When we think that life’s occurrences seem unfair (a human discrimination), we should remember that heaven’s (_tian_) net misses nothing, it leaves nothing undone (ch. 37)

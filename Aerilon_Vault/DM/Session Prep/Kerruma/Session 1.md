- [[Enjara]], village of the [[Al-Nurak]]
	- Enjara, the village of the Al-Nurak tribe, stands as a testament to the tribe's collectivist philosophy. The houses, made of the same sun-baked clay and thatched roofs, are arranged in concentric circles around the Shiek's house in the center, which also serves as the community meeting house, a place for shared meals and collective decision-making. This house is adorned with tribal symbols and the history of the Al-Nurak, representing their shared heritage and unity.
	- In Enjara, resources are pooled and distributed equally among the villagers. Tribe members take turns cooking in the communal kitchens, and decisions are made collectively in the communal house. The Al-Nurak live by the principle that "the tribe is only as strong as its weakest member," and they work together to ensure no one is left behind. Their shared responsibilities and collective decisions underline their unity, and this ethos extends to their dealings with the outside world, always presenting a united front.
- [[Makirah]], village of the [[Umaseti]]
	- Distributed layout without any clear pattern or structure to it
	- Some houses are single storied, others have lofts, some have painted exteriors, others have intricate carvings on their walls. The doors of the houses are often adorned with symbols of personal achievements and tastes, carved from [[Kasika]] gems or painted directly on the clay. The thatched roofs are layered and designed to provide shade and repel the desert heat.
	- The village's lifeblood is the bustling market at its center, where individuals sell and trade goods brought back from the [[Misr al-Ba'id]] trade route. The Shiek's house, the most elaborate of them all, stands on the outskirts, a testament to the tribe's respect for individual power and leadership.
	- In Makirah, the day-to-day life revolves around personal efforts. Each household is responsible for its own sustenance. Disputes are settled through individual negotiation, reflecting their culture of self-reliance. But despite their individualistic nature, the tribe comes together when faced with external threats, showing a sense of communal pride and unity.

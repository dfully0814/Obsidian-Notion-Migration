# Scenes
- [[Galladon]] confronts [[Elleanna Corvus]]

## Galladon Confronts Ell
[[Elleanna Corvus]] is forcefully catapulted up against a stone wall in a large-sized foyer with a polished marble floor that contains four marble pillars extended up to the ceiling another story up. There is a winding staircase on each side of the room leading up to a balcony on the second floor.  The room is lit with dim purple light from the purple flames that hover suspended in the middle of a series of decorative lanterns that hover around the room and slowly move about as though a gentle wind is aimlessly blowing them around. In the middle of the floor is a large dodecahedron built into the marble floor.

> [[Elleanna Corvus]], you feel a tremendous force on your body as you see [[Galladon]] appear before you with [[Teymir]] in the background, a blinding flash of purple light, and then you are violently catapulted forward. (Make a DEX saving throw). Your body crashes against a hard and unyielding surface. You feel coldness against the side of your face as you lie on what appears to be a polished marble floor.
> Around you are four marble pillars extended up to the ceiling another story up. There is a winding staircase on each side of the room leading up to a balcony on the second floor.  The room is lit with dim purple light from the purple flames that hover suspended in the middle of a series of decorative lanterns that hover around the room and slowly move about as though a gentle wind is aimlessly blowing them around. In the middle of the floor is a large dodecahedron built into the marble floor.
> You hear the echoing sound of the slow and deliberate footfalls of chained metal boots against marble from behind you. A low voice echoes, through the foyer, 
> "15 years. 15 years I've counseled you. Trained you. Taught you how to survive. Watched over you. I vouched for you. When I found you, Alina told me you were too young and therefore couldn't be the one we were looking for, but I told you were naturally strong and that I saw something in you I've never seen in anyone else who has called out to us. I told her you'd be different. And you know, you were. You really were. And I'm sure you've often felt like I was asking too much of you. I'm sure I have. And it's because I've seen inside what you are truly capable of. I convinced Alina to send you on this mission. To give you a chance to prove your capabilities. To prove your strength and resolve that you so desperately begged me teach you (voice volume begins to build) WHEN YOUR MOTHER WAS PLOTTING AGAINST YOU TO TURN YOU OVER TO THE WATCHERS AND HAVE YOU CLEANSED. TO SEE TO IT THAT YOU ARE FOREVER TRAPPED INSIDE OF YOUR OWN BODY FULLY AWARE OF EVERYTHING AROUND, SCREAMING AND YET ABLE TO BE HEARD BY NO ONE. AND YOU CHOOSE TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE YOURSELF VULNERABLE ONCE AGAIN BY MAKING FRIENDS WITH THESE PEOPLE YOU WERE MEANT TO INFILTRATE AND FOLLOW. AND THE RESULT? I FIND YOU GROVELING ON YOUR KNEES LIKE A STRAY DOG BEGGING FOR SCRAPS!! (punches into the marble floor creating a large crack). AND NOT ONCE BUT TWICE SOMEONE HAS ALMOST MURDERED YOU IN COLD BLOOD WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP YOU TRAVEL WITH. YOU'VE EXPOSED YOUR INTENTIONS TO THEM. YOU'VE EXPOSED YOURSELF TO THEM. AND YOU'VE EXPOSED US TO THEM."
> "Sit up and look at me. (draws sword). The last person I ever cared about died on his knees too. (tears start slowly rolling down the face). I thought you were gonna help me make it right. You were a little sister to me." (sword lights up in purple flames and eyes start glowing purple). 
> (A regal and firm female shouts from the second floor), "[[Galladon]], stop. You know what she will become and you do not want that for her." A black figure with a porcelain white mask starts to hover along the marble floor from the second floor down the marble steps, making no sound of footfalls as a  shadowy essence billows all around her like the train of a robe. As she gets to the foyer she comes near to you and reaches out a gaunt hand that is almost pale white, caressing your lower jaw and lifting your head slightly to direct your gaze into the mute expression of the mask. "Let her speak."

## Message from Galladon
> Dear one, I'm sorry I have been out of touch for some time. I've recently returned from a venture in the Uncharted North of Aerilon. Our Guide has been updating me on your progress. We've recently become aware of a mysterious material the northerners have referred to as "Chardalyn". A black volcanic-like material with a slight sheen that exhibits whispers and seems to gravely affect the minds of those who are weaker to its influence. This material a good portion of the illegal smuggling rings in the north that I've been able to uncover. It appears the Arcane Brotherhood has also taken interest in this material and is currently conducting a large-scale archaeological dig out near the [[Reghed Glacier]]. Based on intelligence I've gathered, they may have found another ruined Netherese enclave, and I think this Chardalyn might've been what the city was made of.
> Our guide has made me aware of your companion...this "Symund". We believe he has an equal part to play in what lies ahead.

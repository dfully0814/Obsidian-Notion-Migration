# Scenes
## The First Singularity
At some point, either during the fight with the inquisitor or afterward, [[Teymir]] will begin to hear the voice of [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], as he will begin to see the area around him start to dissolve back and forth into the underground cave area of the lighthouse where he'll first see large cages with people in them. then a row of people on their needs next to a tall women in black with a large black headdress. He will see a large black orb in the center of the room pulsating with a bright purple glow while the figures in the scene move but he doesn't seem able to interact with them. He will see a group of Drow guards hand cuffing and chaining John Smith and putting him in a cage they will raise into the air. He will see Leowin being brought in and made to grab the orb that will appear to sap her of her strength and be powered up by her.

If the [[Singularity]] completes, an area of [[Nulmoria]] around [[Thornhold]] will be brought into the [[Prime Material Plane]] permanently and a Core Spawn Worm will break through.

- At some point while they party is in the Laboratory, a sudden rumble and shake will occur as the first stage of the [[Singularity]] is completing, which will spawn **Fractines** (x2) in the room that only [[Yang Tieh]] will be able to see because he drank the wine and Ladore had concocted a potion that allows him to see into the [[Transitory Plane]].

## Fighting the [[Fractines]]
- Use **Fractine** stat block with the following additions:
	- *Rearrange space (5-6). Choose a space you can see within 60 feet of you (no action required). You treat that space as if it were within 5 feet of you until the end of your turn. This allows you to move immediately to that space without provoking opportunity attacks, or to interact with objects or creatures in that space as though they were next to you (including allowing you to make melee attacks into that space). In addition, something from the space chosen is moved to the originating space where the Fractine is.

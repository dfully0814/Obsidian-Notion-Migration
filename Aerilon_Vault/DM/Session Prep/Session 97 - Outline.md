# Scenes
- [ ] [[Ophala Marget]] tells [[Sighi Thorgison]] that [[Teymir]] is there if she finds out. 
- [ ] In the [[Hall of Knowledge]]
	- Famous across the [[Sword Coast]]
	- Badly damaged after [[Mt Hotenow]] eruption
	- Shrine dedicated to [[Helm]] located on the ground floor
	- Staff living areas and offices upstairs, off limits to civilians
- [ ] [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] shopping
    - Any mention of magical items will arouse suspicion. Lots of it. Like asking for material to make a nuclear bomb.
- [ ] [[Vos Industries]] investigation
- [ ] Gambling games in [[The Moonstone Mask]]
	-  **#1 Hand of Fate**  
		**Suggested buy-in**: 50 gold pieces
		Played similarly to Texas Hold ’em casino poker, this DND gambling game has its own flop, turn, and river. The premise of **Hand of Fate** is very simple. Each participating player pays 50 GP to join the pot, although bets may be adjusted based on group preferences.
		
		Then, a player rolls 1d12 die and keeps it secret from his or her fellow players. Each player can then choose to fold and forfeit their bet, call the bet or raise the bet if they feel confident in their roll. After that, a d12 die is rolled that becomes a community dice that everyone can see.
		
		After the roll, players can again call, raise or fold their bets as they see fit. Once this round is finished, another d12 die is rolled, so players now have two community dice. This is the part where players have a final chance to adjust their bets before they have to reveal their own dice.
		
		The winning condition is simple. The player with the highest combined value of his or her own die and the community dice wins 80% of the pot, and the other 20% is contributed to the casino.

	- **#2 Twenty-One**
		**Suggested buy-in**: 25 gold pieces
		Another great addition to the possible DND minigames you can try, **Twenty-one**, is modeled after another real-world popular option, blackjack. In fact, the original name of blackjack was Twenty-one, only in French. It was later changed to blackjack in the United States.
		
		In any event, the basic mechanic of the game applies nicely to dice gameplay. Here is how it works in Dungeons and Dragons. A player will roll 2d10 dice. The dealer will do the same, but only if the dice will be publicly revealed. 
		
		Players and the dealer then have the option to roll as many additional dice as they see fit. However, there is a catch. You cannot exceed 21 as the sum total of your dice, or you lose the game automatically. 
		
		If a dealer rolls a natural 21 from the start, the player(s) loses. If a player rolls 21, the dealer loses. In the case of ties, the winnings are split. Note that all die sides keep their face value except for the 1, which will be treated as both 1 and 11, depending on what you need at the moment of your roll. 
		
		If both you and the dealer have 21, you get a 1:1 payout from your bet. If your roll places you over 21, you bust, and your bets are immediately forfeited. Players win all other bets at a payout of 3:2.

# Enemies
- [[Everwatcher Nullifer]]
	- When the absorber takes damage from a spell, the absorber takes only half the triggering damage. If the spellcaster is within 60 feet of the absorber, the absorber can force the caster to make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. Unless the save succeeds, the caster takes the other half of the damage.
	- The nullifier attempts to interrupt a creature that it can see within 60 feet in the process of casting a spell. If the creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, the nullifier makes a Charisma check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. On a success, the creature’s spell fails and has no effect.
	- _**Reversal.**_ When a creature the reverser can see within 30 feet of it regains hit points, the reverser reduces the number of hit points regained to 0, and the reverser deals 13 (3d8) force damage to the creature.
	- Uses **Aeroian Absorber** stat block

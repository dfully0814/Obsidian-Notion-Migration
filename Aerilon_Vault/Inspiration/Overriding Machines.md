## Overriding a machine

Overriding is the ability to control machines. While an overridden machine cannot be commanded per se, overriding turns a machine from its default state of hostility toward any human to a state of combat friendliness toward the human who overrode it, in that instead of attacking the overrider, it will attack other machines or humans that attack the overrider.

In order to take the Override action, you need an override module installed on your melee weapon. You must move stealthy towards the machine that must be restrained or unaware of you. You use your action to begi verride module near it, than you must wait your next turn.

### Override Check

At the beginning of the machine's turn, you must make a check to continue your override. Roll a d20. If the roll is 11 or higher, you succeed and continue overriding until the beginning of your next turn, while the machine is incapacitated for this turn. Otherwise, you fail, so you stop the Override action, the machine acts normally and has advantage on first attack roll against you. Whenever you take damage while you are overriding a machine, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your action.

The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, you make separate saving throw for each source of damage. If the machine doesn't take its turn for some reason, the Override check is automatically succeeded. At the beginning of your next turn, the Override action is completed, the machine gains the overridden condition and you can act normally.

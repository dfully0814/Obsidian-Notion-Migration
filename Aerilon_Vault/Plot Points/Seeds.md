- The [[Githzerai]] [[Anarchs]] can create spacial realities from the memories of others to protect from their own memories being consumed by [[Elall]]
- The [[Gith]] home of [[Elall]] is trying to consume the minds of its inhabitants
- There is no time dimension in [[Elall]] so the [[Githzerai]] often travel outside the space to raise families, which they learned the concept of from the [[Netherese]].

Wanting to venture beyond [[Elall]] is what sparked the civil war between [[Githyanki]] and [[Githzerai]]

The [[Anarchs]] are crucial for the survival of their people because they can create large citiy-sized temporal spaces from others' memories that [[Elall]] will feed upon instead of consuming them.

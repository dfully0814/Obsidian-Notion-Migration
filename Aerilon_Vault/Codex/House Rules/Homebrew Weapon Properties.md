### Two-handed

A two-handed weapon requires two hands to attack with and cannot be used if it is not being wielded with two hands. This means you cannot wield a shield while carrying the weapon

### Rampant

This property is only on shotguns and similar weapons. Weapons with this property do not impose disadvantage when firing while within 5 feet of a hostile creature. They also allow the wielder to use their Strength modifier instead of their Dexterity on attack and damage rolls with the weapon.

### Heavy

Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a small creature to use effectively.

### Special

The weapon has special properties that you can reference on DDB.

### Automatic

Weapons with the automatic property require no priming or cocking for use, only pulling the trigger. Their trigger can be held down instead of being squeezed for each individual attack. While held down, the weapon discharges three bullets in quick succession. This is called automatic shooting.

Automatic shooting is an action that can only be taken if you have the Extra Attack class feature. You take the Attack action and roll a single attack with advantage. If it successfully strikes your target, roll twice the normal weapon damage dice and add the appropriate modifiers. This is particularly useful for targeting enemies under cover and firing through personal energy barriers and mesh armors.

### Doubleshot

Only machine guns have this property, which represents their ability to fire a vast number of rounds. When you take the Attack action with this weapon (including if you fire automatic by using all your extra attacks), you may make a single attack using your bonus action. You add your normal attack modifiers to your attack roll, but do not add any damage modifiers to the damage roll unless you have the two-weapon fighting style.

### Bulky

This property is on larger firearms and energy weapons and represents the lowest Strength required to carry and fire the weapon without the help of a tripod or gyro accessory). Firing a bulky weapon with a Strength score lower than the marked amount on the Weapons Table imposes disadvantage on attack rolls made and renders you unable to benefit from any of that weapons other properties (such as automatic or doubleshot).

### Scope

Magnification Lens. A scope with this lens doubles the effective ranges of the weapon.

Magnification (Extreme) Lens. This scope lens quadruples the effective ranges of the weapon. It doesn’t stack with regular magnification add-ons, but a regular magnification lens is required to purchase this one.

Night Vision Lens. This scope lens allows the viewer to see as though they had darkvision. If you already have darkvision, your darkvision range is doubled.

### Radius

A weapon with the radius property targets a square, never a creature. Your attack roll is always made against an AC of 10 adjusted for cover against that square. Creatures within 5 feet of the square (or in it) must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw with a DC equal to 8 + your Dexterity or Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. Success means that creature will take half damage from your attack. Radius weapons cannot benefit from a critical hit roll.

### Detonated

Only explosive charges have this property. These charges require an action to set a single charge in a location and an action to prime the detonator for use (detonators can be found in the Weapon Accessories section, and detonated weapons cannot be used without one). Connecting multiple charges to a single detonator requires an action for each charge you are connecting. You can use your action to trigger a detonator (or ready an action to do so). Triggering the detonator causes the connected explosive charges to explode, dealing their damage in a radius as normal. You can use your Intelligence modifier when determining the DC for the saving throw against explosive charges’ damage.

### Slowing

A slowing weapon lowers the speed of those damaged by it by half for 1 minute. After having its movement reduced this way, a creature makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns with a DC equal to 8 + your Dexterity or Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. If they succeed, their move speed is restored.

### Deafening

A deafening weapon renders those damaged by it deaf, as the condition, for 3 rounds. After being deafened this way, a creature makes a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns with a DC equal to 8 + your Dexterity or Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus. If they succeed, the condition ends.

# Gaining Fate Points

## Dropping to 0 HP
- Whenever a PC drops to 0 HP, he will receive 1 Fate Point, regardless if that PC drops to 0 HP more than once per encounter.

## Creating conflict with character flaws
Every character has flaws that you use to develop your character and create situations of conflict for yourself or the party. The flaws of your character now become more useful and more meaningful. Whenever you as a player create a narrative occasion where a flaw of your character would create a meaningful conflict or an obstruction to either your goals or the goals of the party, you will receive a Fate Point.

The DM can also suggest conflict that would occur as a result of a player flaw. This will not be forced on the player but will create a period of negotiation where the DM, the target player, and other players negotiate on what would be the most interesting conflict from the initial suggestion.

The DM will have the final say on whether or not the conflict is significant enough to warrant a fate point. The goal is that the conflict or obstacle should create a noteworthy turn in the narrative or complicate the PC's or party's circumstances in some way that must be addressed now or later.

## Rolling a critical failure
When a player rolls a critical failure, he will immediately receive 1 Fate Point

# Spending Fate Points
## Declaring a story detail
Sometimes, you want to add a detail that works to your character's advantage in a scene. For example, you might use this to narrate a convenient coincidence, like retroactively having the right supplies for a certain job (“Of course I brought that along!”), showing up at a dramatically appropriate moment, or suggesting that you and the NPC you just met have mutual clients in common. To do this, you’ll spend a fate point. You should try to justify your story details by relating them to your aspects. The DM has the right to veto any suggestions that seem out of scope or ask the player to revise them, especially if the rest of the group isn’t buying into it.

## Success on a failed death saving throw
When a player fails a death saving throw, they can choose to succeed instead.

## Gain a +6 bonus to attack rolls, ability checks, or saving throws or re-roll them
A player can spend 1 fate point to gain a +6 bonus to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, or re-roll all the dice. You cannot use multiple points on the same roll.

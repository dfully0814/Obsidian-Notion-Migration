When a player attempts an action that has a chance of failure, compare your result to the opposition (either active or passive) and check the list below to see how well you did:

## **Critical Success**

You succeeded by 10 or more on a skill check, or rolled a natural 20 on an attack. Things have gone perfectly. You achieve your goal and something else happens in your favor.

### Benefit Examples (d20)

1 You restore some hit points
2 You gain a hit di
3 You find some extra gold
4 You gain a favour from an ally
5 You regain a spell slot
6 You deal extra damage
7 You heal some mental stress
8 You may spend a hit die to recover some hit points
9 You may switch places with a nearby ally
10 You can move to an advantageous position
11 You learn a piece of rare information
12 You (temporarily) lose one level of exhaustion
13 A magic item regains one charge
14 The locals hear about your achievement
15 You apply a condition to your enemy
16 A god notices your achievement
17 A condition improves
18 You gain advantage to your next roll
19 Your enemies are intimidated by you
20 You move your enemy

## **Success:**

You achieve your goal.

## Success at a cost
You failed the check by 1-3. It is your choice. If you want to succeed on the check, you must offer to the DM a costly effect to either your character or your party. The DM and the rest of the players will determine if the cost is high enough to warrant the success.

## **Failure**

You failed by 4 or more. Something bad happens—you take damage, gain Stress, lose a hit die, a Condition worsens, etc.

## **Critical Failure**

You failed by 10 or more on a skill check, or rolled a natural 1 on an attack. It's all gone badly for you and you suffer a second consequence in addition to the normal failure effects—you take extra damage, lose a hit die, drop an item, etc.

2 An enemy reacts and takes an action
3 You gain some mental stress

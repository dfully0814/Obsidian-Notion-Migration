The vessel which originally belonged to [[Tanavast Adamantus]], acquired by [[Azure Flint]]. Azure then assembled a crew, including [[Yang Tieh]] and sailed the seas for a few months during the initial outbreak of the [[Darkweave]]. Azure then lost the ship when he drew a mysterious black card from a fortune teller's tent at the [[Sea Maiden's Faire]] in [[Phandalin]].

# Description

[[Captain Alford Ainsley]]'s ship. Controlled by a sophisticated AI named [[ROMA]])

# Ship features

## Size

About 100 feet long sitting on the ocean floor 100ft deep.

## Entrance/Exit

The players can open the hatch from the outside and descend a ladder to the inside

## Ceilings, Walls, and Floors

The ceilings are 10 feet high through most of the main deck and 25 feet high in the cargo bay. The majority of the ship‚Äôs innards are made of durable, plasteel panels (AC 21, 50 hp per 10-foot section, immune to psychic and poison damage). Many of the panels are removable, allowing easy access to the ship‚Äôs computer systems.

## Lights

ROMA controls the lighting throughout the Paramount, illuminating rooms as its crew moves through it. A creature can control the light in a room simply by asking ROMA to change it.

## Doors

Unless it is locked, when a character moves near a door it opens automatically with a ‚ÄòSHUCK‚Äô sound. The few locked doors on the ship are magnetically sealed. A successful DC 15 Intelligence check using proficiency in computers (see Appendix A) allows a character entry. Otherwise, the doors are exceptionally tough to break open, requiring a DC 25 Strength check to pry open. The doors have an AC of 22, 50 hp, and a damage threshold of 5. They are immune to poison and psychic damage.

## Elevators

The Paramount has two crew elevators near the flight deck and a service elevator that allows easy access into the cargo hold from the underside of the ship. Similar to the doors, ROMA operates these without hesitation for crew members (and characters) who ask her permission.

## Service Ladder

A ladder embedded into the wall of the ship connects to a service hatch at the top of the ship and leads down into the cargo bay.

# Areas of the Ship

## 1. Crew Quarters

The first time the characters descend the ladder (marked ‚ÄúC‚Äù on the map) read the following:

## 2. Flight Deck

<aside> üí° A large, curved window dominates the far end of this room. Out of the window you can see the ocean (depending on time of day). Facing the window are five chairs. Two of the chairs sit near the window in front of a lit-up glass panel. The second pair of chairs sit just behind the first. Finally, a throne-like chair sits at the rear, itself with its own lit-panel. This room reminds you of the helm of a large ship.

</aside>

This is the ship‚Äôs helm. Communications and science officers sit at the chairs closest to the window/viewing screen, the ship‚Äôs pilot and tactical officer sit in the central rows, and the captain sits in the rear chair.

Doors at either side of the deck allow access to the deck‚Äôs computer systems.

## 3. Captain's Quarters

Both doors leading into the captain‚Äôs quarters are locked. They only open in the presence of the ship‚Äôs captain, whoever that may be.

Like the rest of the Paramount, the captain‚Äôs quarters are simple and tidy. The captain‚Äôs hyberbed lays horizontally against the far wall, just below the window. However, a button on the wall (and inside the bed itself) returns it to a vertical position, concealing it within the wall. A desk with a glass comp screen takes the place of the bed once it‚Äôs raised, along with a couch and a small table that rise from the floor.

## 4. Guest Quarters

Important guests who book passage on the Paramount stay in this room. It is identical to the Captain‚Äôs Quarters.

## 5. Mess Hall

A long counter beset by seven chairs stretches from the far wall. This was where the crew gathered to eat meals prepared by ROMA.

## 6. Kitchen

Meals were prepared in the kitchen by ROMA. The Paramount‚Äôs kitchen is equipped with a replicator. With a command, the replicator can create a meal for the ship‚Äôs patrons. The food is flavorful, always seasoned to the recipient‚Äôs particular tastes. The replicator can also create beverages, hot or cold, and even alcoholic.

## 7. Maneuvering Thrusters

The ship‚Äôs thrusters are on either side of the ship. Maintenance on the thrusters can be performed from these rooms. Since ROMA and the Blueshift maintain the integrity of the ship, these rooms have often been used as storage or additional guest quarters.

## 8. Infirmary

Injured and sick crew members were taken here, to the infirmary. The infirmary is equipped with a medical bed with a glass casing with 3 small robotic arms attached to the side of the bed and pointed toward the soft area. A creature that spends 1 hour in the Regena-bed recuperates as if the regenerate spell was cast upon them, including the restoration of severed limbs. The Medigen can produce medicine that can end either one disease or one condition afflicting a creature (like the lesser restoration spell).

## 9. Cryostorage

For crewmembers beyond the ship‚Äôs capacity to heal (such as those that have actually died), the ship‚Äôs doctor can place its infirmed crew into one of the three cryo-containers found here. A cryo-container can hold one Medium or smaller creature. If the creature is dead, the creature is protected from decay and can‚Äôt become undead as long as it remains in the container (just like the¬†_gentle repose_¬†spell). Any living creature placed into a cry-container enters a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death; for all intents and purposes, the container works exactly like the¬†_feign death_¬†spell.

All three storage containers are empty.

## 10. Biology Lab

The first of the three research domes is the¬†_Paramount‚Äôs_¬†biology lab. The lab is equipped with multiple counters, tables, and surfaces, as well as shelves containing tools, samples, and other important implements.

It even includes cages which can hold Small or smaller creatures, each equipped with its own version of a meal replicator. With the push of a button on the side of each cage, a¬†_wall of force_¬†descends, locking the creature within.

Finally, a Blueshift fuel cell stays locked in a plasteel container on the wall. The Blueshift was used for experiments.

## 11. Botany Lab

The second dome is home to the¬†_Paramount‚Äôs_¬†greenhouse. Among the lush flora, gardens, and fruit-bearing trees crowding the laboratory are workstations and pushcarts loaded with research tools.

This lab also has its own Blueshift fuel sell locked in a plasteel container.

## 12. Engineering Lab

This lab looks like an oversized workshop. Here, engineers would work on mechanical and robotics projects. On a table at the center of the chamber is the lifeless shell of a robotic humanoid figure somewhat like the figures Yang saw on the island in the Whalebones. It appears to be hollowed out and decommissioned.

<aside> üí° This is where the players found the console to insert Lyra's memory storage device

</aside>

## 13. Cargo Bay

The characters can enter the cargo bay either through the elevators or via service ladder. There is currently no cargo in the service area,but it can hold up to 150 tons of cargo with no issue.

With the exception of the elevators, all of the doors in the cargo bay are locked. Only senior officers of the _Paramount_ are allowed access into those areas.

## 14. Vault - senior crew members access

Precious (or dangerous) cargo is kept in the Paramount‚Äôs vault. Only senior members have access to this room.

## 15. Armory - crew docent and captain

Series of laser pistols and laser rifles.

## 16. The Submarine

The underwater escape pod bay connects to an attached submarine with a simple control deck.

## 17. Fuel Cells

Both of these doors are locked; only senior crew members have access. The prototype Blueshift fuel cells that power the Paramount and give the ship its regenerative abilities are held in these two well-protected rooms. Surprisingly, the rooms and cells were damaged in the crash, leaking Blueshift all in the ocean. The unstable nature of the fuel is what created the mutated creatures that haunt the ocean around the ship. Since the crash, ROMA has improved the structure of these rooms, making them nearly indestructible.

# Description
The ceremony a [[Protectorate]] leader undertakes when they are left behind after the majority of their men and women die in battle. The [[Everwatch Knights]] believe that their fallen soldiers will be dishonored at [[Helm]]'s side unless they have their leader to guide them and continue to lead them. This process involves the [[Protectorate]] leader choosing someone to take their sword and kill them with it. It is customary for that person to then wield the leader's sword in battle the rest of their lives.

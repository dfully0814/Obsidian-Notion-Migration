# Description
The first dynasty and nation of Elves established during the [[Age of Arcanum]]. At its height it stretched along the [[Sword Coast]] from [[Cormanthyr]] to the River Delimbiyr.

Its capital was [[Vulleth]], Elven for 'deep waters'. During the [[Calamity]], the [[Betrayer Gods]]—[[Lolth]] in particular—began to win over the power hungry, fearful, weak citizens of the empire who had become panicked and afraid at the sight of the coming war between [[Primordials]], Betrayer Gods, and [[Prime Deities]]. 

Originally devoted to the god [[Corilon]], many of the Elves began to turn to the power of the Betrayer Gods, finding strength and formidably against the coming war—many believing Corilon had abandoned them.

The empire was sundered in two during the civil unrest culminating in the [[Shadow War]].

# Description
Believed to have lead the [[Prime Deities]] in the war of the [[Calamity]] and also lead in the creation of the [[Prime Trammels]] used to banish Tharizdun from memory.

Also referred to as the “Dawnfather”. Some of the largest temples in [[Aerilon]] are either dedicated to Pelor or [[Helm]].

# Description
Over time, some of the people of [[Toril]] grew arrogant. Seeing their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, a belief developed that, with enough understanding, they too could become as powerful as the gods. Many began to shun faith in favor of their own pursuits. Though this hurt and surprised the Creators, they understood the willfulness of their children and endured out of love and hope for redemption.

Great kingdoms sprung up across [[Toril]] . Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcansists' newfound power. Erudite cities hovered and drifted through the skies, shifting under the direction of scholarly magi to wherever their interests took them. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new creatures and power.

The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Petty squabbles erupted over resources and wealth among the elite, while the rumor of immortality through perfected arcanum began to drive the greatest mages wild with a lust for unending power. Notably, Archmage [[Vespin Chloras]], ruling Archmage of the [[Netheril Empire]] School of Conjuration, sought the guidance and power of the long forgotten [[Primordials]], rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing them into the mortal world soon becoming twisted by an unknown force beyond the awareness of even the most powerful mages.

These powerful twisted being spawned unthinkable horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed. The [[Betrayer Gods]] and their hateful children discovered a world unspoiled, save for the avarice of mortals. The urge to ruin was now replaced with the desire to dominate, and the [[Betrayer Gods]] began by turning on the mage who freed them, making [[Vespin Chloras]] their first thrall. This corrupted divinity sought out the remnants of their offspring, scattered across the world, and created a mighty and terrible new kingdom on the plains of the country of [[Illefarn]] (present-day [[Cormanthyr]] ), the city of [[Vulleth]].

In this land of evil, where the twisted power of the [[Primordials]] seeped into [[Toril]] , the lords of darkness tainted the minds of mortals, hungrily welcoming those who had lost their way, and offering great promises and boons to hearts easily swayed. These poisonous seeds found fertile ground in the hearts of mortals obsessed with the unlimited power of the arcane or those who had been cast aside and were oppressed and powerless against those who did have power.

Evil was repulsed momentarily, but with the revelation of such a terrible foe, a dangerous arms race began. Trust between mortals and the [[Prime Deities]] was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the [[Betrayer Gods]], who was an ally? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eye of the gods, how were they relevant? Not trusting any but themselves, the self-interested and singular humans reforged their instruments of celebration into instruments of incredible powerâ€”artifacts that could be wielded by worth heroes.

For the first time since the [[Primordials]] were destroyed, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their people on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the [[Calamity]].

# Description
Named by those faithful to the [[Sirin]] for the first time when the [[Sirin]] itself attempted to give rebirth to the world and erase its memory of [[Tharizdun]]. The ritual was corrupted by a remnant essence of [[Tharizdun]], which had corrupted [[Dunamis]], causing the world to be sundered in two, birthing two worlds neither of which were like the original and each bearing their own crippling deficiencies.

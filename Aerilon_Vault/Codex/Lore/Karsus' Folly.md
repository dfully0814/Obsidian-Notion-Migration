# Summary
Cataclysmic event during the reign of the empire of [[Netheril Empire]] when the archmage [[Karsus Tanthul]] attempted to bypass the [[Weave]] and siphon the raw, concentrated, and chaotic energy behind it into himself in order to access a seemingly limitless source of arcane power.

This resulted in magic ceasing to function for a temporary amount of time, which caused all the majestic [[Netherese Enclaves]] to plummet to the ground, effectively ending the Netherese empire over time.

To this day, it is not known what Karsusâ€™ true motivation was for attempting this feat.

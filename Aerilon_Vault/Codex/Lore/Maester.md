# Description
This was a title given to [[Netherese]] mages when they were acknowledge as a subject matter expert in the practice and study of a particular school of magic. Maesters were highly respected and revered among Netherese societies since they often were the ones tasked to pass on their knowledge to younger generations.

They also often oversaw the documentation and preservation of their knowledge in the libraries and archives of [[Netheril]]. Therefore, in a sense, they were more of a scholar than a practical tactical practitioner of their specialized area of study.

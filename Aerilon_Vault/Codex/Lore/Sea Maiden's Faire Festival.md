# Description

A celebration in [[Luskan]] of the maritime heritage and the bounty of the sea. The faire is typically held in the early winter months. the harbor of Luskan is filled with brightly decorated ships and boats, and people gather along the waterfront to watch the various nautical competitions and events. These may include races between different types of ships, fishing contests, and demonstrations of maritime skills such as knot-tying and navigation.

On land, vendors sell seafood delicacies such as oysters, clams, and crabs, as well as other treats such as saltwater taffy and ice cream. There may also be games and activities for children, such as face-painting, balloon animals, and sandcastle-building contests.

One of the main events of the festival is the [[Blessing of the Fleet]], in which the local clergy bless the ships and their crews, asking for protection and success in their voyages. This is often followed by a procession of ships through the harbor, with the crews waving to the crowds and tossing flowers and other offerings into the water.

This is a memory that has been wiped from Vos. Brandt will look younger by about 15 years or so.

> Remember when we used to come here when we were kids? When you would come stay with us while your dad was off on deployment? Damn, I used to hate the water. Whenever we'd dream about discovering the world together, you'd always tell me that if I didn't deal with it then other folks would get to all the good places first and it wasn't no fun finding something second. You were always the brave one between us. When the Watchers pulled my number for the program, I know you went in my place 'cause you knew I want'd ready. I still remember the day I read your letter telling me what you'd done. 
> 
> This business venture. I don't know. The Watchers 'been using every resource they' got to hunt down every Scourger from here to the east. What makes you think we can amass enough money, resources, and connections to disappear?
> Vos responds, "'Cause I'm smarter than they are."
> Brandt again, "Hehe. Well you better the hell be." Look, I met a man named [[Korris]] in [[Yartar]]. Low-level security guy for some fat cat named [[Harlex Phylund]] not satisfied with his current employer. He's got some connections that should help us with new identities, but it ain't gonna be cheap and I don't know how far we're gonna have to go. 
> 
> Look, I didn't come out here to talk business. Hell, you know I ain't good at these kinda things. I know every time you kill, it takes a little piece of ya' that you don't get back and most of you didn't come back.  You know, for my money they got the better pick of the two of us, but dammit Bren it was supposed to be me. What am I supposed to do?

> Vos: When this is done, get a pretty wife. Some kids. Big yard. The whole thing.

Lanterns start hovering up over the horizon:

> Guide: Memory and time transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.
> Memory can be such consolation when you find yourself dashed upon the rocks by the winds of the world. It took some doing to find something strong enough to tether you here. It may appear to you as though there is nothing left of the crucible of your soul to be passed through the fire again, and yet here you are. 

Vos may ask some generic questions about where he is. The Guide will explain that it's a place of respite, of protection from an endless and hungry void that grows between two worlds.

> Many centuries ago, a small group of creatures from beyond the world taught me how to carve a reality from the strong memories of those who carry them. I was asked to not allow your soul to spill into the void. 

She will then point to a row boat floating out on the shore and tell him to get in it and start rowing in order to find out.

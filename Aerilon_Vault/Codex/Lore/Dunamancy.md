# Description
_Dunamancy_ is an ancient, esoteric study of a mysterious force called [[Dunamis]] almost unknown across [[Toril]].

Facets of _Dunamancy_ have quietly bled into the more common applications of spellcraft like an unrealized glimpse behind the curtain of creation. Mages who pursue the study of this strange and complex force call themselves _Dunamancers_, and their interest in learning to alter the fabric of gravity, potential, and time often coincides with a hunger to understand the oldest mysteries of the cosmos.

Manifesting as translucent gray energy that shimmers and drifts like an ethereal cloud of mist when gathered, _Dunamis_ darkens as it vibrates and condenses to the moment of action or invocation, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality. Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possible timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.

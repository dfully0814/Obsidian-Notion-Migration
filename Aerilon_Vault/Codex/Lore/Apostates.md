# Summary
Magic users who are caught illegally using or studying magic. The [[Arcane Brotherhood]] is the arm of the [[Everwatchers]] empire, which bears many responsibilities. One of these is to regulate and govern the use and availability of magic in the realm.

Only those chosen by the Arcane Brotherhood and trained at an early age and who succeed in a mysterious series of trials are granted the license to study and practice magic.

Anyone caught practicing magic unlawfully is taken to the [[Requilary]] in the heart of [[Waterdeep]] and undergo the [[Cleansing]].

The [[Everwatchers]] often goes to great expense to apprehend known Apostates far and wide, believing them to be the greatest enemy of the empire, particularly due to the events of [[Karsus' Folly]] and the ongoing hostility with [[Thay]].

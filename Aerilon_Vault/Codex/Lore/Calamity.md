# Description
The battlefields of the catastrophic showdowns of the Calamity were scattered across [[Toril]], but it was the present-day region of North [[Aerilon]] that suffered the full destructive powers of the gods, where the [[Betrayer Gods]] began to assault the first children of creation, The Elves, from above and below resulting in the creation of the [[Drow]] race.

The immensity of power wielded by the [[Prime Deities]] and [[Betrayer Gods]] was enough to wound the landscape for eons, and the irresponsible use of arcane knowledge developed by the mortals ensured the ruin of their own legacy.

During the time of the Calamity, when it seemed as though [[Tharizdun]] would rise up and end all that is known and will ever be known, the Sirin came to aid the gods in banishing Tharizdun before all that was held together by it ceased and the "first light" was snuffed out. Combining beads of the essence of the [[Sirin]] while also adding beads of their own divinity, the prime deities--lead by Pelor crafted The [[Prime Trammels]], using pure platinum as a metallic base. With the combination of the essences of the Sirin and the gods, the platinum became a new material unlike anything found in the world--what the [[Netherese]] later referred to as Incarnum.

The [[Sirin]] , finding no nature within it to kill or destroy, sought to consecute the world, destroy it, and trigger a rebirth, erasing all memory of the darkness brought to bear by [[Tharizdun]] and therefore emptying him of all his power and influence, effectively banishing him physically and in the memories and hearts of all of creation.

However, all didn't go as planned. During the apocalyptic struggle to erase [[Tharizdun]] from existence, several trammels were destroyed, sending shards throughout the world.

Since the [[Rites of Prime Banishment]] did not complete successfully, enough of Tharizdun's presence remained to corrupt the consecution process. Instead of producing a rebirth of the world, the world was sundered into two worlds, much of the old world a corrupted and twisted shadow of the new where [[Tharizdun]]â€™s presence remained, and the new world haunted and plagued by memories of the old.

This left the [[Sirin]] exhausted, having given so much of themselves to the [[First Consummation]], seeing that their presence was not long for the world, they placed their essence into [[Sirin Beacons]] that were scattered throughout the universe. They then fell into a deep sleep within the core of the world, waiting for a time when their children would live enough lives through struggle and self-reflection until their knowledge had matured enough to reassemble them.

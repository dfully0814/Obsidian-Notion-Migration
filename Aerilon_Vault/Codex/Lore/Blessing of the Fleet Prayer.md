Prayed by [[Everwatchers]] clergy during the [[Blessing of the Fleet]] for the [[Sea Maiden's Faire]]

*O mighty Helm, protector of the faithful and defender of the righteous, we come before you today to ask for your blessings upon these ships and their crews. As your followers, we know that the sea can be a treacherous and unforgiving place, filled with dangers both seen and unseen. But we also know that with your guidance and protection, the sailors who brave these waters can find safety and success.

*We pray that you will watch over these ships as they set sail, that you will guide their captains and crews with your wisdom and your strength. Keep them safe from storms and rough seas, from pirates and sea creatures, and from all the other dangers that might beset them on their journeys.

*We ask that you bless the nets of the fishermen, the sails of the traders, and the swords of the defenders, that they might all find good fortune and success in their endeavors. May the bounty of the sea be plentiful, and may the profits of their labors be justly earned.

*Finally, we ask that you bless this harbor, and all those who call it home. May it be a place of safety and refuge, of commerce and culture, of community and kinship. May the people of Luskan always honor your name and your teachings, and may they strive always to live with courage, justice, and compassion.

*We offer this prayer to you, Helm, in the name of all those who sail upon the sea, and in the name of all those who seek your guidance and your protection. May your light shine upon us always, and may your justice prevail.*

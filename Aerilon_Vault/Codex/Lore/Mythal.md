# Description
An ancient and powerful Elven ritual used to create powerful magical enchantments or wards across entire areas that could so alter the [[Weave]] that the normal natural laws and rules of magic no longer applied.

For example, a typical mythal could prevent certain schools of magic from being employed and empowering others.

It is believed the creation of a powerful Mythal required the sacrifice of a life, and the Mythal would often be named after the individual who chose to pay the ultimate price.

# Description
Creation myths and legends abound throughout [[Toril]]. Many of the more ancient and primitive myths from minority races such as the giants and elves are widely regarded as fiction and are only believed to provide historical value to understand the culture and storied history of these races.

As the world moves ever toward technological advancement and pursuit of higher learning and understanding, explanations regarding the beginning of the universe have moved toward naturalism, particularly after the [[Age of Arcanum]].

Among the most civilized areas of [[Toril]], it is widely believed the universe sprung from a mysterious primordial and chaotic energy. Many ancient cultures believed this energy was actually sentient and formed creatures known by many names but most widely known as the [[Primordials]]. Many religions worship various primordial entities as deities.

It has lately been discovered that the [[Sirin]] seem to have also played a role in the Founding, seeming to even predate primordials and possibly seem to even be the potential source of the primordial energy from which primordials were generated, but it is unclear exactly what role they played beyond that and what their purpose was.

# Description
The monster in the closet. The hungry beast under the stairs. The fear distrust and paranoia among friends, or among kingdoms. The name of Tharizdun is carried along with the wind like a distant and faint but haunting byword spoken among drunks in ram-shackled pubs.

Tharizdun is the name sometimes invoked by the most maligned conspiracy theorist to explain all the bad in the world—a name never invoked by any respectable person.

Tharizdun’s legend is found mostly in relation to ancient histories recorded concerning the [[Calamity]] but not much beyond that.

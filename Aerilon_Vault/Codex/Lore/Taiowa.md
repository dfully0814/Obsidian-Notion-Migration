Appears to be a deity worshiped by the Reghed tribes. Believed to be to have once been served by the machines in the North but was betrayed by them after they were distorted and lead astray by what they refer to as a "[[Metal Devil]]".

The tribes believe Taiowa's holy mountain lies at the top of [[Kelvin's Cairn]] where she is believed to dwell.

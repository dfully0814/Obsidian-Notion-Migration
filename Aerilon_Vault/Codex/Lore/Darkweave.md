# Origins
Caused by the influence of [[Tharizdun]] upon the [[Prime Material Plane]] as more [[Shadow Crossing]] have begun opening across [[Toril]].

# Symptoms
Enhanced “core memories” followed by a loss of them like long-term memory loss. As the identity is consumed, the person infected starts exhibiting physical symptoms like graying skin, elongated appendages, and other anatomical changes. This happens because the Darkweave is tricking the brain into believing it is from [[Nulmoria]] and always has been. The body, therefore, begins to physically adapt to that environment.

# Diagnosis
More powerful thralls of [[Tharizdun]] like [[Shadovar]] and [[Dreadmasters]] wear mementos that were special to them in life in order to keep the power of their memory as closely tethered to the world as possible because the presence of memory not consumed in the presence of Tharizdun is the most powerful.

Less powerful and average creatures infected by the Darkweave will first exhibit mental symptoms of enhanced experience of long-term memories and then loss of those memories or at least difficulty apprehending those memories at the early stages.

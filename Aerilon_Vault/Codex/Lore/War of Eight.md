# Description

Thayan Archmage of Necromancy, [[Telamont Tanthul]] was the primary instigator of the uprising within the council (see [[Netheril Empire]]).

The war lead to the split of the [[Council of Eight]] as Tanthul and those other archmages loyal to him were driven from [[Thay]] and crossed the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to eventually build the [[Netheril Empire]].

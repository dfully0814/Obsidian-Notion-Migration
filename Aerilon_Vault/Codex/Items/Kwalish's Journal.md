# Notes
The cover of Kwalish's journal is set with all manner of gears surrounding a dial in the middle that looks like an hourglass cut in half and turned upside down. The gears appear to be in working order. There are wires connected to the back of the journal coming out of holes cut in the wood and leading to a pile of junk.

On the first page of the journal, you see written at the top in Common, "[[Kwalish Tanthul]], School of Artifice. [[Thultanthar]] enclave." Underneath the heading, you see what looks like a shimmering polaroid picture that’s been slightly over-saturated with color and overexposed. In the picture you see three figures, the first of whom you immediately recognize as [[Klovag]], robed in purple and black with purple and gold embroidered designs around the seams of the robe and what looks like a large floating city in the middle.

Next to him, you see three other Hobgoblin figures, one female with long black hair, lots of jewelry hanging around her neck, and several tassels dangling from her hair. Next to her are two [[Hobgoblin]] boys. On the back of the printout of the picture is written in Goblin, "Dearest [[Rillan Tanthul]], my warmth, and light. I hear your voice from Elysium's fields and I will find you again."

The journal starts with a brief intro that where Kwalish shows excitement about being sent to the mountains by Archmage [[Telamont Tanthul]] to research a crashed [[Netherese]] vessel. He mentions being excited and proud that his two sons, [[Randryn Tanthul]] and [[Derkas Tanthul]], were chosen for an apprenticeship in the school of Artifice and he would be allowed to be their instructor. He mentions that he was allowed to bring them on this expedition now that they are "of age" and looks forward to seeing them grow in knowledge, and he also writes that he is excited to show them "all that is possible."

The journal outlines Kwalish's fascination with extradimensional spaces and the infusion of magical properties into artifacts in order to learn how it works. You pass over drawings of planar diagrams and hypotheses regarding the existence of various planes and the possibility of travel between them.

Regarding planar travel, he writes about how during the [[Age of Arcanum]] he believes powerful mages were able to travel to and from the planes of the gods and walk alongside them. He writes about the Age of Arcanum in a pretty negative tone and mentions it as a time that man was physically and intellectually shackled to the gods. He mentions that since the [[Divine Gate]] was constructed, physical travel across the planes is no longer possible to perform safely beyond the [[Prime Material Plane]].

The diagrams are mostly laid out as figures in the appendix of a book except these are the first pages in the journal. You also see several maps drawn. You see a map of [[Aerilon]] with much less detail than the one in your possession. You see that the empire of [[Netheril Empire]] is featured prominently in his drawings of Aerilon. The empire looks like it primarily stretched from the High Forest and [[Nether Mountains]] in North Aerilon east into what is now on your map labeled the [[Anauroch Desert]] but on his map is written "Netheril" on that section of land, with several other city names listed around it. Two particular areas are circled as you see below with annotations next to them.

You find some research notes about the [[Wyrmspeakers]]--a semi-religious organization that venerated and often worshiped what they referred to as [[Dracoliches]] which was founded by a Netherese archmage named [[Sammaster Arran]], later known as the "Wyrmspeaker." Kwalish mentions Sammaster believed his destiny was to live forever and raise dragons who would live forever and rule all of [[Toril]], no longer being in subjugation to the [[Primordials]] as they were created to be. He starts to theorize, and writes about the possible ability of [[Incarnum]] to influence other creatures and if that is how the Wyrmspeakers influenced them as they did to gain control over them.

There's also an emphasis on a material he refers to as "Incarnum." He seems intent on finding it. He writes about this area, "The [[Deep Maw]]", mentioning it was a rift torn into Toril during the [[Calamity]]. He writes out a hypothesis that such rifts exist elsewhere across Toril and lead to "areas inhabited by underdwellers living in a city made of [[Incarnum]]." He goes on to postulate that the Netherese constructed their famous [[Mythallar]] from this material which they must've procured by violence against the underdwellers or some kind of mutual trade.

He goes on to write some about the properties of Incarnum particularly seeming to focus on its relation to Mythallars and how they functioned. He expressed a theory that Incarnum must have an affinity for binding other materials to it or binding one material to another and acting as something of a "bonding agent" between foreign materials that normally cannot interact. He mentions that this is likely how the Netherese were able to bind magical properties in a stable way to an external material that could persist over long periods of time and be used as a stable energy source.

Later in the journal you see active research notes. Kwalish mentions acquiring a substantial amount of Incarnum from archmage [[Telamont Tanthul]] for researching its application for planar communication beyond the [[Divine Gate]]. As his notes continue you see an ebb of flow of success and failures of using other automated constructs to help him build a Mythallar out of the Incarnum and then attempting to bind and enhance communication spells to the Incarnum along with spells that he postulates allow for planar travel through what he refers to as the Transitory Plane.

As you continue flipping pages you start to see his handwriting become gradually more hurried and sloppy. Little punctuation, words pressed together without spaces as he starts to write excitedly about being very close to a breakthrough. He begins to describe hearing Rillan's voice as clearly as if she were in the room after a particular test of the Incarnum as he destabilized an energy cell and focused it into the [[Mythallar]], attempting to find the correct balance of energy and arcane properties. His writing becomes much more emotional than esoteric as you begin to see symbols drawn in the margins (crushing wave symbol).

A page or two later you read the following:

> All the knowledge of Tultanthar could not prepare me. Dear gods, I've done it. I've found my Rillan. She came to me. She was as radiant and warm. She said she'll lead me to the fields where she dances. She said the way to her side is to the south where the Water and Earth planes border and are at their thinnest. She told me I must find Erusta in the land of the elements. Oh, my love, keep your eye upon me. I see you watching me even now. I will find you….

Another excerpt a few pages over reads…

> I have discussed my findings with Archmage Tanthul. He is most impressed and intrigued. He warned me that piercing this fane would not be possible without significant power for the Mythallar, an ancient power made of the rawness of the elements of the chaos itself. I told him this sort of power could only be found in a Primordial, long-extinct since the [[Founding]]. I mentioned mythic Land of Elements, "[[Laerkond]]" in the Dwarven tongue who are said to inhabit it, known as the final resting place of the fallen Primordials. He told me about [[Erusta]] (another odd Elven name for a deity), a Primordial  who became something of a revered deity to the Elves and worshiped as a goddess of elemental water and patron of seafaring. I will find what remains of the Elves and procure from them the location of this "Larekond", whatever the cost. Archmage Tanthul willing offered some of his [[Shadovar]] to escort me. I'm most grateful, but he mustn't know about Rillan and continue to think I do this for the good of the empire.

A later excerpt

> We've found the remnants of the Elves on an island across the sea they refer to as [[Evermeet]]. They've told us that Erusta lives on Laerkond to the north of Aerilon. Tanthul has always taught us to never trust Elves so we acquired one of the highborn daughters as collateral in the event they are sending us to our deaths.

> We've found Laerkond and brought the highborn with us. The atmosphere here is strange. I was able to triangulate the location of an incredible energy source. However, it's far too powerful for binding with a single Mythallar for transport. I've read the Elves have unique traits in their bodies that allow for channeling powerful magics and energies, given to them as the First Children of the gods. I might be able to synthesize an ancient [[Mythal]] with enough Incarnum and a willing or unwilling participant. We've begun final preparations. Rillan, even if I fail I know your guiding eye will lead another to open the way to the fields where you run and I will find you again in this life or the next. You'll love how much the boys have grown. They're so much wiser than me…

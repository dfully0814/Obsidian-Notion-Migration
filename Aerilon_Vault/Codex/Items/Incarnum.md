# Significance
Name used by the empire of [[Netheril Empire]] when [[Telamont Tanthul]] led an expedition into [[Deep Maw]] and discovered a mine of a mysterious dark orange mineral. These mineral ores are the remnants of the pieces of the [[Prime Trammels]] (see [[Rites of Prime Banishment]] used by the [[Prime Deities]] and the [[Sirin]] to attempt to banish [[Tharizdun]] and the memory of him from existence by rebirthing the world. The process failed, sending shards of the trammels throughout the material plane.

The material has an organic nature to it, as it maintains the living essence of the entities within it. It sustains the life and organic nature of other organic entities--binding energy, magic, and other essences to it or significantly enhancing them.

As energy is bound to Incarnum over time, the potential of that energy increases at a steady rate, making spells or entities bound to it much more powerful when released in contrast to their power initially.

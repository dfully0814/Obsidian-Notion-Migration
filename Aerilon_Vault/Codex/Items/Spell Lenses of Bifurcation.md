Spell lenses are glass disks about 1 foot in diameter. When you use an action to toss one into the air, it hovers directly in front of you at a distance of 1 to 3 feet. Thereafter, another creature can use an action to grasp or net the lens by any means at its disposal, either by making a successful DC 16 acrobatics or athletics skill check that is appropriate. You can use an action to seize and stow the lens, ending its effect. A lens has ACT 16, 20 HP, and vulnerability to thunder damage when attacked.

When you have multiple lenses deployed, they arrange themselves in a stack in front of you. You can change their order and/or reverse the faces of any number of lenses as an action. You can only PHYSICALLY move the lenses a distance up to your walking speed each turn. You can also move a lens through teleportation at any distance if applicable on your turn.

Spell lenses change the properties of spells that pass through them. They affect:  
- Spells with discrete targets.  
- Spells with ranges greater than Self or Touch  
- Spells that create effects at a point of origin.  
- Spells that project physical manifestations that can pass through the lens, such as line spells and some conjuration spells.  
- You cannot ever be the target of a spell entering or leaving the lens

If you have multiple lenses deployed, they apply alterations to spells in the order in which they are hovering.

For spells with multiple discrete targets, treat each portion as a separate instance of a single target spell.

This lens splits a spell into two lesser copies that must have DIFFERENT targets. Any actions or choices you make or prior changes to the spell apply to both copies. If concentration is required for the spell, that concentration applies to all copies. If concentration is broken, all copies of the spell end. The duration of the copies of the spell are reduced by half.

For spells that require attack rolls, each spell copy will have a separate attack roll with disadvantage. If the spell requires a saving throw, all targeted creatures have advantage on saving throws against all spell copies. Also, if the spell does not require an attack roll and does damage, the damage will be split for each additional copy of the spell.

Only a single spell or copy can pass through a single lens.

Other creatures who are un-attuned to a stack of lenses cannot cast spells into those lenses which are attuned to by another player.

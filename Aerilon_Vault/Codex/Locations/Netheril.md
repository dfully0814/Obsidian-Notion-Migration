# Summary
- Most powerful human dominant magocracy in history that was formed after the [[War of Eight]] when [[Telamont Tanthul]] and several other loyal [[Thayan]] archmages were exiled from [[Thay]] and sailed over the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]] to [[Aerilon]] where they banded together to pursue the untapped power of the arcane they always sought before
- Made up of legendary floating cities known as [[Netherese Enclaves]], each overseen by a Netherese Archmage. Advanced devices known as [[Mythallar]] powered the floating enclaves.
- The downfall of the empire began after the events of [[Karsus' Folly]] and many enclave ruins are excavated throughout [[Aerilon]] and hold particular research interest with the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]
- Instigated [[The Appropriation]]

The nobles spoke [[Loros]], while the commoners and inhabitants of [[Low Netheril]] spoke its sister language [[Netherese]].
- Today, [[Loros]] is considered a dead language as the majority of speakers died in the events of [[Karsus' Folly]].

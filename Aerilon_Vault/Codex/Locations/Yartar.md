# Summary
Situated in the fork where the [[Surbrin River]] and [[Dessarin River]] in join near the [[Evermoore Way]], Yartar is a fortified town that, were it not for its own petty, internal squabbles, might wield more influence among its fellows in the North. Currently, it is most remarkable for its barge-building operation (and that industry’s importance to the commerce of other settlements) and its annual fairs.

A vast [[Hiring Faire]] is held in Yartar on a yearly basis, during which all sorts of undesirable folk gather north of the town looking for work as guards, miners, farmhands, guides, or other unskilled laborers. For the most part, those who attend this fair are brutes, bandits, freeholders whose lands can no longer sustain them. While this event is going on, Yartar is overrun with visitors it would rather not welcome, who steal goods, sell wares in the street (sometimes those they have just stolen), meet unscrupulous contacts to hand off the coin, information, or purloined items, and engage in the occasional spell duel. It’s quite common for a new adventuring company to come into being at one of these fairs when those who stand out from the crowd because they have legitimate skills to sell gravitate toward one another and decide to form a group.

Yartar is ruled by a [[Waterbaron]] who is elected for life. The current Waterbaron is [[Nestra Ruthio]] a hot-tempered woman who is wickedly calculating; though she is free with her words and her insults, she seldom takes action against rivals unless she is sure such can be done to the most efficiently painful effect.

It is conflicts and schemes such as this that keep Yartar from gaining prominence in the North. If the town can overcome its internal problems, take advantage of what its fellows in the [[Alliance of Protection]] can offer, and find a way to reap greater profit from its position along major trade routes — where it stands as the gateway to all the settlements of the northeast — Yartar might soon grow in size, wealth, and influence. Physical growth would require clearing terrain for further settlement and building another encircling wall to protect settlers — and additional guards hired to protect those who do the work.

With its location near two great rivers and its proximity to a third, Yartar is a fishing town, and its tables have fish as fare at every meal. Fresh crabs, eels, and other river life are available both to eat and to purchase, and serve as a primary means of income for the fisherfolk of the town.

The other major industry of Yartar is barge building. Most of the region’s river barges are built, or at least begin their service, in Yartar, and the works of the town’s bargewrights are famous all up and down the [[Dessarin River]] and its tributaries. It is the importance of Yartar’s barges to the commerce of the North that earned the town a place in the [[Council of Waterdeep]], to ensure that Yartar doesn’t fall to enemies and cause upheaval in the trade network along the rivers.

What can’t be transported to or from Yartar by barge comes and goes by caravan instead, and the town’s location makes it a key stop for most caravans passing between [[Waterdeep]] and [[Silverymoon]]. In Yartar, a caravan can arrange for swift repairs, replacements of wagon wheels, carts, or full wagons, or the replenishment of tack and other accessories.

Because Yartar has so few industries, and fewer close neighbors, its merchants are often in direct competition with one another and have neither the resources to seek new customers, nor space or funds to explore new trades. As a result, a good deal of the gossip, thievery, and assault in Yartar has at its roots one merchant trying to get the upper hand on a rival, either through damage of goods, intimidation of workers, or theft of patrons and customers.

The [[Waterbaron]] utilizes the local Everwatcher city [[Protectorate]] to curtail raiding and thieving and chasing off raiders from further north.

More impressive than either the Shields or the Shield Tower is the [[Waterbaron’s Barge]]. This massive vessel can carry two hundred soldiers or seventy-five Shields of Yartar with their horses. Its sides above the waterline are armored with iron. Behind its walls stand multiple crossbow contraptions, each able to fire a dozen bolts at once. When brought to bear against a force on the riverbank, the Shields lose two volleys against their enemies, then bring the Barge ashore and charge. No raiders have stood firm against such an assault.

In the center of town is the [[Waterbaron's Hall]], a grand structure that is both the ruler’s home and the location where she hears audiences. Feasts are often held here, though more often, the hall sees activity in its side rooms, where merchants dealing in large quantities of goods, or making deals and proposals that affect the entire community, can meet in comfort.

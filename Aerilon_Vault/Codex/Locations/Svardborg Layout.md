Svardborg is an iceberg with several giant-sized lodges situated in a ring on it. Three of the lodges are entombed in ice, while the remainder are partially exposed. All the lodges have a thick layer of ice on them, indicated by the pale blue ring on the map. The hollow heart of Svardborg is a flooded ice cavern that is open to the sky and where the frost giants moor their enormous ships.

Ceilings. Unless otherwise noted, ceilings inside the lodges are 40 feet high with 30-foot-high rafters.

Climbing. A creature can scale the icy cliffs of Svardborg and the ice-glazed walls of the lodges with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. The cliffs that form the outer edge of the iceberg are 50 feet high, except for the wall that adjoins the docks (near area 3), which is 10 feet high.

Cold Weather. The temperature throughout Svardborg is well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. The rules for extreme cold and frigid water apply (see the “Wilderness Survival” section in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master’s Guide).

Doors. Svardborg’s doors are 25 feet tall and made of thick wood, with handles positioned 11 feet above the floor. A Huge giant has no trouble opening one. A smaller creature can attempt to open a door, provided that creature or some other helpful creature can reach the door’s handle and unlatch it. While the handle is unlatched, a creature must use an action to push or pull on the heavy door, opening it with a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check.

Illumination. Continual flame spells cast on torch sconces cast a pale bluish light that illuminates some areas.

Oversized Furnishings and Objects. Most of the furnishings and other items in Svardborg are sized for frost giants. Exceptions are noted in the text. Tables, benches, and other room fixtures are typically twice as high, long, and wide as their human-sized equivalents and roughly eight times the weight. Small and Medium creatures can scuttle under and clamber over giant-sized furniture, treating the spaces the furniture occupies as difficult terrain.

Stairs. Staircases within Svardborg are sized for frost giants. Each step is 3 feet tall by 3 feet deep. Medium and smaller creatures treat the staircases as difficult terrain.

Vessels. The frost giants use two types of ships: greatships and punts. These vehicles are made of frost-covered wood and have sails made from dragon wings. When not in use, the ships are anchored and their sails are lowered.

-   Greatships are longships sized for frost giants. A typical greatship measures 240 feet from bow to stern and requires a crew of at least ten creatures that are Large or bigger. A greatship has a speed of 6 mph, AC 15, a damage threshold of 20, and 3,000 hit points. It can hold up to twenty giants plus 200 ton of cargo.
-   Punts are keelboats sized for frost giants. Each is roughly the same size as a human-scale longship. A single giant can steer a punt, and a crew of eight Small or Medium humanoids can operate one as well. A punt typically holds two giants and up to 10 tons of cargo. It has a speed of 2 mph, AC 15, a damage threshold of 15, and 300 hit points.

The iceberge is very isolated and requires a seafaring vessel to reach.

**Approaching Svardborg**

Svardborg is so isolated that the frost giants don’t bother posting lookouts. Their lack of vigilance makes it easy to approach the iceberg unseen.

**By Water**

Characters who approach Svardborg by water can tether their vessels to the 10-foot-high wooden docks south of the Drydock Lodge (area 3). Or they can avoid the docks and scale one of Svardborg’s 50-foot-tall icy cliffs, tying their boats to a spike hammered into the cliff face. Neither of these methods of approach attracts attention.

If the characters enter the hollow interior of the iceberg, they risk being spotted by the creatures on the greatships (areas 7 and 9). The gate is up, but the characters can maneuver their rowboats through the gaps between its thick chains.

**By Air**

Characters who approach Svardborg on flying mounts can land on the outer docks (near area 3) without attracting attention. Although the iceberg’s central grotto is open to the sky and it’s possible to land griffons on the decks of the greatships within, doing so without being noticed by the creatures on the greatships is impossible.

Characters arriving by airship can land the vessel in the water by the docks. There are also a few landing zones on the iceberg itself, each marked with stars on the map. These areas include two flat patches of ice and snow between areas 1 and 2, as well as a pillar of ice west of area 2 that’s connected to the main iceberg by a natural ice bridge. Other places on the iceberg are ill equipped for landings, because the terrain is sloped. Characters can also land their vessel on the water inside the central grotto, but the creatures on the greatships (areas 7 and 9) automatically spot them.

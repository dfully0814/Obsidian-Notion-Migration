# Summary
The vast gulf of time and space left over after the failed [[First Consummation]] of the [[Sirin]]. The space is referred to only as the "Transitory Plane" by scholars who seek to uncover more of the mysteries of the cosmology of the universe such as the many scientific guilds of [[Aerilon]] which are often employed by the [[Everwatchers]] to aid in research and discovery.

The true nature of this space is not known by the majority of these scientific guilds. This is the primary reason the [[Everwatchers]] give the guilds resources and funding to further their research. They want to keep the guilds close in order to monitor their discoveries and make sure it is not discovered that the space is a graveyard of the gods

# Summary
Frontier posh area created by the nobility of [[Waterdeep]], specifically funded by [[House Cassalanter]] and [[House Grahlund]] to serve as a place of fun and respite for the hardworking nobility of Waterdeep.

Amphail lies north of Waterdeep on the [[Long Road]]. The town is named after one of Waterdeep’s early warlords, who is said to haunt the surrounding hills in spirit form, frightening away monsters. Horses are bred and trained here, rich Waterdhavians maintain secluded estates in the hills, and farmland is plentiful. Stands of dark duskwood and spruce trees are everywhere. Amphailans are by their nature suspicious of and quiet around folk who openly display wealth or status, having learned early in their lives that nobles are folk who like to throw their weight around, to the detriment of anyone nearby without enough coin or a grand enough title to stand up to them.

These common folk are ideal sources of information about the very people they distrust. For their part, the young nobles that litter the town seem to make mischief mainly because they can. The feuds and rivalries that would generate only carefully worded insults in the city can escalate into brawls when these miscreants are far from the watchful eyes of their parents. Duels have long been prohibited by mutual agreement, due to the blood feuds they provoked in the past, but hands often drift to sword hilts when heated words are exchanged.

Nearly every other sort of noble indiscretion is foisted on the residents of Amphail. Those who suffer property damage or worse at the nobles’ hands are forced to forgive the offense in exchange for the application of coin or a promise made in the transgressor’s name (suggesting that the youngster’s relatives will handle any obligations).

Some businesses survive entirely by bringing the comforts of Waterdeep to Amphail, creating gathering places where young nobles can feel at home. The three Waterdhavian noble houses with the most influence in Amphail are House Cassalantar, House Grahlund, and [[House Roaringhorn]]. In accordance with the [[Alliance of Protection]], a new representative from a different house than the current representative is elected every [[Shieldmeet]] to sit on the [[Council of Waterdeep]].

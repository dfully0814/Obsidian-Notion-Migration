# Summary
- Large gathering place in [[Good Mead]] that appears to have once been a dragon temple.

# Important Locations
### **Entrance** (far left)
Leading up to the entrance of the mead hall is two flights of stone steps with a small landing separating them. At the top of the first flight of steps are two stone statues flanking either side of the landing. Each statue is the form of a large dragon.

The one on the left appears to be coiling around a large tree with wings spread wide and looking forward. There's a large bronze plate at the base that reads in Draconic, "[[Auril]], the Mother of Creation"

> We bow to She who wears the crown; Let the world shiver with dread. Clad in winter's whitest gown, Her snow enshrouds the dead.

Her fury sheds but frozen tears as gray clouds issue forth Her wind across the wasteland shears bringing blizzards from the north.

All the world in winter's white, sheathed in sleet and ice. Set upon never-ending night, She conjures paradise.

Behold her everlasting rime, see how it covers all. Weep not for those she traps in time behind Her glacial wall.

Sovereign of summer's lost, General of winter's war; Long live the One of cold and frost. May She reign forevermore.

On the right, you see the second Dragon statue perched upon what appear to be some kind of broken and porous mountain crags. It also as both large wings unfurled and is looking down with a ferocious look on its face as though it as just landed. At the base of the statue you see another bronze plate that reads "[[Arharzel]], the Nightmare in Ivory"

> In our childhood rumors ran Of a world beyond our door Terrors tot he life of man That the highroad held in store.

He has no darting tongue Teeth saw-edged, nor rattling scales No fire issues from his lungs, No black poison from his tail.

He is a create of dark air, Unsubstantial tossing forms, Thunderclaps of man's despair In mid-whirl of mental storms.

And there's a true and only fiend Worse than prophets prophesy, Whose full powers to hurt are screened Lest the race of man should die.

Laying all across the steps are bodies of men and women dressed in basic leather attire overlaid with fine heavy leather coats while others are wearing armor that looks like leather mix with a metal material. Along the gauntlets and at various other places you see a faint orange glow coming through creases in the metal portions.

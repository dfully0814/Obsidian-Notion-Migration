This hall has the following features:
	- A magnificent harpsichord sits in the hall.
	- A crimson carpet runs down the hall toward an open door to the foyer.
	- Light from a crystal chandelier reflects off more than three dozen silver chalices

[[#Map]]

    -  The floor is caked with mud. Several rows of muddy boots and gardening gloves are strewn about the floor.

[[#Map]]
## C3 Library
This is the Cassalanters’ private library. It contains the following features:
    -   The scent of old parchment hangs thick in the air.
    -   The walls are lined with tall shelves packed with colorful, leather-bound books. Each bookshelf is outfitted with a ladder on a rolling track to enable people to reach the highest books.
    -   Shelves that take up the entire southwest wall hold not books but eighty wide-necked glass bottles filled with swirling mist and sealed with corks.
    -   Hanging on the north wall between two bookshelves is a 7-foot-tall portrait of Lord Edmur Cassalanter and Lady Alathene Cassalanter holding two infant children and standing beside their teenage son, Symund. (This portrait conceals a secret door.)
    -   Secret Door. The Cassalanter family portrait hides a secret door. Tilting the painting causes the door to swing outward on hidden hinges, revealing the pantry (area C11) beyond. A character can notice a slight gap beneath the secret door with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check.
    -   **Jars of Mist.** The glass bottles on the southwest shelf contain magically captured sounds, including songs, operas, and recorded lectures. Uncorking a bottle temporarily releases its auditory contents into the library, after which the sound returns to its bottle. Breaking a bottle releases the sound, but the sound dissipates after it plays once. All the bottles are labeled. Sample contents include the following:
        -   “Ahghairon’s Dragonward,” a lecture given by Khelben Arunsun about the dragonward that protects Waterdeep (see “[Ahghairon’s Dragonward](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/adventures/wdh/introduction#AhghaironsDragonward)”).
        -   “Canticle of the Silver Chalice,” a hymn to the demigod Siamorphe.
        -   Wulfgar and the Crystal Shard, an epic opera detailing the adventures of a barbarian, a dwarf, and a drow in Ironhaven.
        -   “Your Beardy Face,” a traditional dwarven love song popular in the Moonsea region.

[[#Map]]

    -   Light pours into this room through four tall bay windows that look out on the butterfly garden (area [C25](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C25ButterflyGarden)).
    -   Furnishings include a luxurious armchair and a small side table where an empty wine glass sits atop a small book.
    -   A door in the northern wall has a butterfly-shaped, stained-glass peephole.
    -   **Journal**
        -   A journal can be found on a night stand here which will reveal the Cassalanters are working with a Thayan contact in the North and funding the experiments with Chardalyn in order to destabilize the region and draw the Everwatchers away from the Reghed Glacier.

[[#Map]]
## C5 Foyer
Two [guards](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard) in House Cassalanter livery are stationed in this marble-floored foyer at all hours. It has seven exits:
    -   A door to the entrance hall (area [C1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C1EntranceHall))
    -   An open arch that leads to a spacious dining room (area [C9](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C9FamilyDiningRoom))
    -   Three unmarked doors on the east wall (to areas C6, [C7](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C7Cloakroom), and [C8](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C8CoveredPorch))
    -   A grand staircase that ascends to the second floor (area [C13](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C13Ballroom))
    -   An unassuming door under the stairs that leads to the cellar (area [C26](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C26Cellar))

[[#Map]]
## C6 Office
The door to this room is locked. The room contains the following features:
    -   Tall stacks of legal tomes and financial ledgers rest atop a solid mahogany desk.
    -   A freestanding suit of bronze armor (complete with helm, gauntlets, and greatsword) stands just inside the door.
    -   Armor. The suit of armor standing by the door is a helmed horror. It obeys a Cassalanter’s commands. When no Cassalanter isn’t present, it attacks anyone who opens the door without a key or anyone not of Cassalanter blood who opens the desk. The Cassalanter children know about this construct and warn friendly characters about it.
    -   Desk. A character can pick the lock by succeeding on a DC 18 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. The desk drawer contains thirteen sealed scroll tubes, a signed contract inside each one. These contracts outline the terms of loans made by House Cassalanter to various nobles, merchants, and guilds. The drawer also has a secret compartment that characters can find with a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. It holds a holy symbol of an upside down Ziggaraut with an eye in the middle crafted from solid gold (worth 250 gp).

[[#Map]]
## C7 Cloakroom
This walk-in cloakroom contains the Cassalanter family’s expensive coats and cloaks, and it also has room for the garments of up to one hundred guests.

[[#Map]]
## C8 Covered Porch
This covered porch is the entryway typically used by the Cassalanters’ servants. Ten servants (human commoners) eat here at mealtimes.

[[#Map]]
## C9 Family Dining Room

    -   The gold table settings and candlesticks are worth 2,500 gp in total.

[[#Map]]

[[#Map]]
## C11. Pantry
This room contains the following features:
    -   Casks of ale, fresh water, and cooking oil are stacked in the middle of the room.
    -   Shelves of foodstuffs and ingredients line the walls.
    -   The back wall of the pantry is one large wine rack that contains a variety of splendid bottled wines. (This wine rack conceals a secret door.)
    -   Secret Door. The secret door to the library (area C3) can be detected by a character who makes a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check. The character discovers that lifting a bottle of Baldur’s Gate pinot noir from the rack unlocks the door and allows it to be pushed open.

[[#Map]]
## C12. Smoking Room
This room contains the following features:
    -   One [guard](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/guard) in House Cassalanter livery stands here, absentmindedly examining the regal portraits that adorn the walls and rest on fancy easels in various spots.
    -   Fine armchairs arranged throughout the room smell faintly of pipeweed; the scent is almost obscured by incense and delicate perfume.
    -   If Lord Cassalanter has invited the characters to his home for any reason, he meets them here. If the conversation turns to business, he has Willifort bring his guests glasses of fine brandy and pipes filled with pipeweed.
    -   Portraits. The portraits on the walls depict several generations of Cassalanters. The ones on the easels, more recently painted, include the following:
        -   A somber young Bertio with his beaming human father, Erard Cassalanter
        -   A wedding portrait, showing Victoro and Ammalia smiling and carefree
        -   Twelve-year-old Osvaldo holding a ceremonial rapier
        -   Ammalia sitting with baby Erard and Gytha in her lap while Edmur reads them a fairy tale

[[#Map]]
## C13. Ballroom
This elegant ballroom contains the following noteworthy features:
    -   In the center stands an eerie, human-sized wood-and-cloth mannequin with a painted face. It is dressed like a ballroom dancer.
    -   The polished marble floor is a dazzling mosaic that depicts a silver chalice.
    -   Gilded mirrors and handsome tapestries festoon the walls. Along the west wall, windows with crimson drapes stretch from the floor to the ceiling.
    -   Despite its grandeur, this ballroom seems strangely dismal without anyone dancing in it. Stairs lead down to the foyer (area C5) and up to a hallway outside areas C17 and C19.
    -   Dancing Construct. The dressed “mannequin” is a magical construct that serves as a dance partner. It has the statistics of a nimblewright (see appendix B) but has no effective attacks and is worth 0 XP. When a humanoid bows or curtsies before the construct, it makes the other gesture while a magic mouth spell plays a recorded message in Common: “Which dance would you like? Galliard? Pavane? Waltz?” The construct follows its partner’s lead until the dance ends, when it becomes still again.

[[#Map]]
## C14. Banquet Kitchen
The banquet kitchen is an additional cooking space used in conjunction with the main kitchen during social functions. It is otherwise empty, and its doors are locked.

    -   The table is a giant mimic
        -   The mimic is Large and has 75 (10d10 + 20) hit points.
        -   As an action, it can make three attacks: two with its pseudopods and one with its bite.
        -   It has a challenge rating of 3 (700 XP).

[[#Map]]
## C16 Piano Room

This room is generally empty unless a social event is taking place.

[[#Map]]

    -   Strewn about on the floor are giant stuffed toys, jack-in-the-boxes, dolls, and a rocking horse shaped like a warhorse.
    -   A large mobile in the form of a butterfly hangs from the ceiling, turning listlessly.
    
If she hasn’t been dealt with elsewhere, the twins’ nanny, Laiba Rosse (see “[Head Servants](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#HeadServants)”), sits here and crochets dolls for the children.

[[#Map]]
## C18. Twins' Bedroom
The twins’ bedroom contains the following features:
    -   Two four-poster beds take up the bulk of this room.
    -   The room is cluttered with toys chaotically thrown about like a scuffle took place
    -   A life-sized stuffed unicorn stands in one corner.

[[#Map]]
## C19. Master Sitting Room
Lady Cassalanter’s attendant, Tissina Khyret (see “Head Servants”), spends most of her time here when she’s not with her mistress. The room is furnished for comfort and includes overstuffed chairs, fainting couches, and a wine bar.

[[#Map]]
## C20. Linen Closet
This closet is packed with folded bedsheets and other assorted linens. Two of the downy duvets stacked in this room are rugs of smothering that attack any creature that isn’t a Cassalanter or one of their servants. Any combat in this room draws the attention of creatures nearby.
    -   _**Lockbox**_
        -   Golden lockbox can be found here containing vials of green substance (stolen memories). DC 16 DEX with tools to pick

[[#Map]]
## C21 Master Bedroom
The door to this room is locked. The room contains the following noteworthy features
    -   The walls are adorned with nine friezes, each one depicting a layer of the Nine Hells.
    -   A four-poster bed draped in deep red curtains and tipped with gold spires stands before an ornate door carved from dark hardwood with a gold latch. (This door is locked and leads to area [C22](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C22AmmaliasPrivateStudy).)
    - A search of the room reveals a golden lockbox tucked under the bed.
	- Golden Lockbox. Both Bertio and Erys keep their cult regalia in a solid gold lockbox (worth 750 gp) hidden under their bed. The box can be unlocked with either Victoro’s or Ammalia’s golden key, or by a character who makes a successful DC 14 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools. It can also be pried open with a successful DC 16 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check.
	- If the box is opened by any means other than a golden key, poison gas sprays out from holes in the underside of the lid, filling a 15-foot-radius sphere centered on the box. This trap can’t be disarmed. Any creature in its area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The gas dissipates quickly.

[[#Map]]
## C22 Ammalia's Private Study
The door to this room is locked. The room contains the following features:
-   The walls are lined with bookshelves packed with thick tomes.
-   A grimoire with a red leather cover sits on a desk carved from dark oak.
-   A ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling.

Bookshelves. The books on the shelves include works of fiction and nonfiction.

**Desk**. Aside from the grimoire (described below), the desk holds an ornate golden candlestick (worth 125 gp), a golden inkwell (worth 25 gp), and a feathered quill pen (worth 15 gp). The desk drawer contains a wax seal bearing the Cassalanter crest, Ammalia Cassalanter’s spellbook (which contains all the spells she has prepared), and ten vials of jet-black poison known as midnight tears (see “[Poisons](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg/running-the-game#Poisons "Poisons")” in chapter 8 of the _[Dungeon Master’s Guide](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/dmg "Dungeon Master’s Guide")_). Ammalia plans to taint the Founders’ Day feast with the poison (see “[Special Events](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#SpecialEvents "Special Events")”).

**Red Grimoire**. The tome on the desk, bound in crimson leather, details a diabolical ritual that Ammalia and Victoro enacted to first contact the archdevil Asmodeus. Opening it reveals nothing but blank pages with a few drops of dry blood on them. If a drop of humanoid blood is spilled on any page, Infernal text on that page becomes legible, remaining so until the book is closed. The blood remains even after the text vanishes.

Any character with the Ritual Casting feature (or the Ritual Caster feat) who spends 24 hours reading the book can master the ritual described within. The ritual takes 11 minutes to cast and requires incense and a vial of unholy water (which are consumed during the performance of the ritual). At the end of the ritual, a proxy of Asmodeus appears and grants its summoner the benefit of a [commune](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/commune) spell. The proxy is formed of incense smoke and resembles a pit fiend. A character must finish a long rest before performing the ritual again.

**Trapdoor**. The trapdoor in the ceiling is the entrance to the attic.

[[#Map]]
## C23 Attic Landing
A thick scent of sulfur pervades the attic. The only illumination is a beam of light that shines feebly through a shuttered window at the west end of the room.

This attic is soundproof as long as no doors are open. Osvaldo’s howling can be heard outside the attic only if the trapdoor between this room and area [C22](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C22AmmaliasPrivateStudy "C22") and the door between this room and area [C24](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C24OsvaldosPrison) are both open at the same time. Additionally, creatures that have telepathy can’t communicate telepathically with creatures outside the attic unless the doors are open.

Terenzio and Elzerina have heard howling coming from the attic two or three times in their lives and are curious about what lurks there.

## C24 Prison

[[#Map]]
## C24a Attic Storage
This room contains derelict furnishings draped in black linens: chairs, coat racks, freestanding mirrors, dress mannequins, and the like. These draped objects take on a sinister countenance in the gloom but are harmless.

[[#Map]]
## C25 Butterfly Garden
In the spring, the gardens attract caterpillars, which transform into butterflies come summer. The butterfly garden is the envy of the all the noble houses. The sweet scent of flowers and herbs filters up from the planters and rose bushes.

*Some sort of encounter here*

[[#Map]]
## C25a Garden Balcony
This balcony overlooks the grounds of the Cassalanter estate and even offers a view of the Sea of Swords beyond the outer wall of the Sea Ward.

[[#Map]]
## C26 Cellar
This cellar is kept free of dust and cobwebs by servants. It is unsettlingly cold, no matter the time of year. It contains spare furniture, a laundry tub, and trunks full of old clothing.

[[#Map]]
## C27 False Vault
The door to this vault is made of solid iron and sports three different locks. Victoro and Ammalia each have a set of keys for them. Opening the door without the keys requires a character to succeed on three consecutive DC 20 Dexterity checks using thieves’ tools. On a failed check, all three locks reset. The door has AC 19, a damage threshold of 10, 90 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. A creature can break it down with a successful DC 27 Strength ([Athletics](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Athletics)) check.

**Cold Trap**. If a creature enters the vault without first saying “Gold is my shield,” an intense blast of magical cold fills the room. All creatures in the vault at that time must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A [detect magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/detect-magic) spell reveals the secret to disabling the trap: a tiny magical glyph is inscribed in the middle of the ceiling. If this glyph is dispelled with a successful casting of [dispel magic](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/dispel-magic) (DC 16), the trap ceases to function.

[[#Map]]
## C28 Wine Cellar
This cellar contains the following features:

-   The east wall is lined with nearly thirty cask s of wine.
-   A faint draft comes from the south end of the wine cellar. The draft betrays the location of a secret door.

The servants rarely spend much time here, since the cellar is unlit and cold. Characters feel a strange sense of foreboding here.

**Secret Door**. A faded holy symbol of Siamorphe, a silver chalice bearing a golden sun symbol, is painted on the south wall. If the sun symbol is pushed, the wall grinds open, revealing area [C29](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#C29SecretVault) beyond. A character who searches the wall automatically detects the secret door and can, with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ([Perception](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Perception)) check, figure out how to open it.

[[#Map]]
## C29 Secret Vault
Most of the Cassalanters’ wealth is tied up in investments, but the family keeps a stack of twenty 5-pound silver trade bars (worth 25 gp each) here for emergencies. At the back of the vault is a dark staircase that descends 30 feet to the temple of Asmodeus (area [A1](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#A1HalloftheDamned "A1")).

Founders’ Day. In addition to the treasure noted above, the vault contains five hundred sacks containing 1,000 gp each (liquidated family assets). If the Cassalanters were successful in looting the Vault of Dragons, the vault contains an additional five hundred sacks (the sum total of the treasure taken from the vault), for a total of 1,000,000 gp. The gold remains here until it’s taken down to the temple (see “[Special Events](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wdh/hell-of-a-summer#SpecialEvents "Special Events")”).

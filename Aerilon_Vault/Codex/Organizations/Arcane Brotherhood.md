# Summary
The Arcane Brotherhood was established by the [[Everwatchers]] in order to regulate and understand the arcane arts and regulate its use.

# Motivations
The brotherhood plays the long game, working to subtly increase its power across the empire and beyond. Popular decisions are often publicly presented as the will of the brotherhood, while conflicted issues are tailored to seem purely the “will of the Crown,” driving a wedge between the two bodies. The brotherhood seeks to write history to favor its members as the architects of modern law and culture, with the eventual goal of subverting the power of the king, turning him into yet another puppet of the brotherhood’s goals.

Brotherhood mages believe that only they have the knowledge and talents to truly guide the empire into greatness. Aside from political matters, the brotherhood is focused on locating and excavating powerful relics and magic lost to the. Its members believe that their original namesake was the apex of society across all history, and they seek to reclaim their place as paragons of mortal rule. Thus, all salvaged texts and artifacts of power from that era are to be recovered at all costs.

The curious discovery of the power behind the empire of [[Thay]] has recently drawn much of the brotherhood’s attention. The mysterious, primal force known as [[Dunamis]] could change the world’s understanding of magic itself — and could even be the key to placing the brotherhood above all other rulers and nations.

The brotherhood has dedicated immense effort to studying and exploiting this new form of magic.

# Relationships
- Tenuous relationship with the [[Everwatch Knights]]

# Structure
- The Arcane Brotherhood uses a similar structure as the ancient Zulkir structure of the nation of [[Thay]], employing eight specialized members. In contrast to the Thayans, however, the eight positions in the brotherhood specialize in eight political areas of the empire, downplaying a focus on magic school specialization and setting the organization up as a political authority in the empire.

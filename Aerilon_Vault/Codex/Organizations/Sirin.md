# Summary
-  Before the [[Calamity]], ancient cultures believed the Sirin were fierce warriors and guardians of "things that should not be known" and protectors of [[Dunamis]] .
-   When it seemed as though [[Tharizdun]] would consume all that was, the Sirin performed what is known as the [[First Consummation]], named by those faithful to the Sirin for the first time when the Sirin attempted to give rebirth to the world and erase its memory of [[Tharizdun]]. The ritual was corrupted by a remnant essence of [[Tharizdun]], which had corrupted [[Dunamis]], causing the world to be sundered in two, birthing two worlds neither of which were like the original and each bearing their own crippling deficiencies.

- Somewhat centrally located for any overland distribution

**Primary Research and Development Facility / Specialized Production**
- Just east of [[Everlund]]
- Access to waterway for distribution
- Legitimate R&D for Vos Industries

**Special Projects / R&D / Other Sketchy Stuff Facility** 
- Forrest East of [[Luskan]]

- Other facilities/staff are unaware that this location exists

# Summary
Ancient tribal people native to the [[Uncharted North]] who live in settlements near the [[Reghed Glacier]].

High-tech [[Netheril Empire]] machines patrol the area of the underground ruined city, so the tribe have become adept at hunting the machines and salvaging parts from them to incorporate into their own weaponry.

They have marked off what they refer to as a [[Zone of Corruption]] which they've found to be areas where the "Corruption" begins to influence and affect those who enter it, including the machines. This is particularly in the surrounding area near the [[Reghed Glacier]].

Any member of the tribe who ventures into a [[Zone of Corruption]] is automatically banished from the tribe and made an outcast and exile

# Motivations
# Relationships
- Tense relationship with the [[Cahokia]] tribe since the onset of the [[Corruption]]

# 5 Senses
-   Primitive gear mixed with high-tech gear
# Structure
-  The tribe is a matriarchal society. The [[High Matriarchs]] are the leaders of the society. Becoming a Matriarch is dependent on how many generations of living progeny a woman has; if an entire generation dies, she is demoted to a lesser status. Elders, Healers, Braves, and hunters are all considered to be important members of the tribe as well, though most hold no political power. However, mothers with multiple living children are assumed to have the highest status in the tribe, especially those who have grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

- Sometimes the [[High Matriarchs]] will appoint the most capable Braves as a "Seeker", who will be granted the freedom to enter any [[Zone of Corruption]] or venture outside the territory the Ruith inhabit.
# Religion
The Ruith worship a goddess they refer to as [Taiowa](https://www.notion.so/Taiowa-0c445cd572b14e5d969b5b65de4261f5), who they believe dwells in the base of the mountain of [Kelvin's Cairn](https://www.notion.so/Kelvin-s-Cairn-a25ee1345710404d89dfc39cf2e9fae6). They are aware of an advanced magical civilization and believe the civilization was destroyed by [Taiowa](https://www.notion.so/Taiowa-0c445cd572b14e5d969b5b65de4261f5) because of its corruption. Those faithful choose a primitive life. Because of their reverence for [Taiowa](https://www.notion.so/Taiowa-0c445cd572b14e5d969b5b65de4261f5), the tribe is a matriarchal society.

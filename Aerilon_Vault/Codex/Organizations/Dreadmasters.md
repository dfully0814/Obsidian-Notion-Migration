# Summary
Warriors with often unnaturally high intelligence who are killed and influence by [[Tharizdun]] into his service, being too powerful in their own right for him to completely control them and therefore becoming more powerful as the essence of the [Sirin](https://www.notion.so/Sirin-49d5a18bee7a4b8789d58d29067c855a) within them mixes with [[Tharizdun]]'s power. Life and anti-life coalescing.

Dreadmaster's carry trinkets on their person to tether their memory to the material world enough that they are not totally overtaken by [[Tharizdun]] and become weaker thralls. The [[Darkweave]] is at its strongest when it feeds on memory and not when all memory is consumed. Dreadmasters are typically high in charisma, while [[Shadovar]] are high in intelligence and usually more willing to give themselves over.

The beginning of journal log for [[ Polaris Detarish]], [[Provost]] of the school of [[Dunamancy]], [[Thultanthar]] Enclave. Our new expedition begins. We were sent from the [[Consortium]] with [[Iras Delacrux]], our adept Abjurer from the [[Karsus Enclave]]. We were told this primitive place was ripe with [[negative energy]], which we found enhances the power of an interesting new material we received from the Dwarves they say they mined out of [[Laerkond]]. I guess you don't have to be powerful to be reckless. We hope to finally devise a mechanism to combat these damned [[Phaerimm]] before they consume us all. That delusional [[Kwalish Tanthul]] came with us, his wretched book burning an obscene hole in my satchel, but when you're perpetually lodged into the back side of [[Telamont Tanthul]] himself, you're not as limited in fanciful and dangerous ideas.

Stone 2

What a macabre place. We have come into contact with the natives. [[Nexalese]] they call themselves. They haven't taken kindly to our presence. We offered them some gems, which they seemed oddly very interested in. Seems they like to sit them in little pots in front of some big statue they call [[Kisin]], no doubt some dubious god they revere. That has appeased them for now. It seems they came to the coast from [[Maztica]]. Their leader calls himself [[Yucatec]]. He's just as stunningly delusional as Telamont, babbling on about visions of eyes of fire guiding his people across the see, him being chosen to save his people so they can live forever, and other nonsensical dribble. But they do intrigue me. The old man and a few of these primitives seem to be oddly ashen and frail. They don't move about quite like men should and seem oddly formidable. No doubt we there is more than one object of study.

Stone 3
The unscrupulous....savages! They turned on us. They came while we slept. It's as if they moved with the shadows. We heard nothing. They kept saying we were meant to be final offerings for [[Kisin]] to open a "bridge to his eternal shore". Several of us they rendered unconscious with some kind of poison, but thank [[Imoulaum]] for [[Jhanna]] and her celerity and for professor [[Ioun]] lending her to us. She has proved quite useful in excavating some of the caved-in areas. She certainly proved her worth during our expedition to the island caverns off the coast. She and her apprentices used their prowess to cast the beguiling bastards to stone, quite well-preserved mind you, including the original colors of their clothing. Jhanna is still young and overzealous, some are not as well preserved as we would have hoped, having become halved in size. That will make the restorative process somewhat...tricky. Of course, we plan to free them when our work is complete. We don't need a second war. For now, we just placed normal ones in the western burial room and the......abnormal ones.....in their grim little toy room to the south. I didn't want to complicate things, but Jhanna has an odd sense of humor.

Stone 4

*Under duress and heavy breathing/shortness of breath* Time is short. Gods, the stench the words leave on my tongue. I'm a listless fool. [[Kwalish Tanthul]], he's betrayed us all. All of my recorded research destroyed, save what I had in my satchel. When we excavated to the first tier, we found more primitives, but they were not what we expected. We expected resistance, but these men were raving mad. We managed to subdue them. Kwalish wanted them alive. He took them to the lower chambers. Said we needed to study them. So we studied them with his little bugs from [[Laerkond]]. I know it was Tanthul...... He'd spent months in that lab using those natives like rodents and it started driving him into deeper delusions. He as his apprentices became as barbaric as the natives. He said we could become a weapon against the [[Phaerimm]] to save Netheril.... *sounds to be holding back sobbing...then it bursts forth* --gods--they came down us in a torrent of shade and blood. [[Mystra]], merciful Mystra, the shreaking sounds. He was something else. Something that shouldn't be. He stood there like a indignant robed shadow and watched as his shades mercilessly slaughtered his own people. But they spared Iras. I saw those creatures shift and move in ways unknown to this realm, I saw Iras bound in chains as the shadowed bodies surrounding him were absorbed back into the natural flow of time so I could get away. No doubt they will find me soon., but they'll find only bones. One mote of [[Incarnum]] left.

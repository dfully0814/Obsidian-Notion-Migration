You hear the sound of the fly buzzing again, sounding like it’s right next to your ear, and then suddenly a fly lands on your hand. The ambience around you starts to slow as your hands begin to shimmer. You’re sitting on a polished wooden floor, dark gray hands overlapping one another, a fly landing on your hand, flying off, and then landing again. It causes you to review each ring on every other finger on each hand adorned with various geometric shapes. It’s been so long since you’ve really looked at them.

Through strings of long dark hair hanging over your face as your head seems to droop, you see in front of you a series of what appear to be classroom desks organized in a stadium-style seating in what appears to be a large lecture hall with large decorative metallic cylinders hanging from the ceiling with various geometric shapes cut out of them. Each cylinder seems to be lit on the inside sending the highlighted shadows of all of the shapes cascading down and around what otherwise would be a dark hall. You see only moonlight outside of a large back panel of windows at the apex of the hall. A few drops of sweat drip from the black tips of your hair. It’s not the heat. It’s the nerves. And then a blinding light, as bright as the sun rises in the window, but it’s too close to be the sun, and it’s night time. Then you hear a deafening pop followed by the sound of thousands of shards of glass clanging into one another as a large ball of fire blasts through the large glass wall at the back of the hall, followed by 3 flying white-haired figures with large flowing robes that seem to extend outward like menacing wings as they fly through the gaping hole in the glass and alight at the top of the hall as you quickly rise to your feet.

As you stand periodically stunned, you hear a restrained but earnest female voice from behind you, coming up and over a podium you have been leaning against, “Ildan, we must act now! This is our only chance!” She’s speaking a language you shouldn’t know, but you do. Three hellishly dark bolts sail from the back of the hall, crashing into the podium sending it flying into the opposite wall and yourself with them. “Ildan!” she screams as she runs over to you. You look up to see an ornate geometric shape with 12 flat sides, a single handle on each end, and a pulsing orange glow at its center. The female figure gets over to you, leans over as you are pulling yourself up from the ground, coursing pain throughout your body. She places a hand around the back of your neck and pulls you in close, touching her head with your’s. “Ildan, I will tell Telta and Ithrel that you have been brave. Be among them, find how they can be stopped no matter how many lifetimes it takes. I will find you again and will always guide you. I love you, my son.” 

You forgot how impressively fast she could be, you think to yourself as you almost hear a whizzing in the air as you see the blurry image of the blade at your neck line the orange light in the device almost overflowing--and then…...darkness.

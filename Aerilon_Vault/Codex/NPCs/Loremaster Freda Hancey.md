# Summary
- Self-appointed keeper of the [[Hall of Knowledge]]
- Cares only about the books and lore kept in the library, obsessively indexing and reorganizing the entire collection.
- Aggressive and distrustful but not cruel
- Antagonistic toward anyone trying to gain entry into the [[Vault of Tomes]]
- Have been many attempts to kidnap her due to her vast lore knowledge
- Very difficult to earn hear trust, except for those dedicated to [[Helm]]
- When [[Mt Hotenow]] erupted, the clergy sealed the [[Vault of Tomes]] and the rest of the undercroft to protect the valuable lore within, but they also accidentally sealed Freda inside. Sanity was factored when she was found and found her fixated on the preservation of lore at all costs.
- Over the next thirty years, she became an eccentric recluse who wandered the library at all hours of the day and night, compulsively categorizing and re-categorizing the collection

# Summary
- She awoke in [[Nulmoria]] a lost, broken, and fragmented individualâ€”remembering nothing about herself or how she came to be here
- Over countless ages, she has managed to piece together elements of who she was, who she is, and what her purpose is; however, she seems to not have uncovered it all. She did not divulge to [[Elleanna Corvus]] how she pieced this information together.
- She once was a regent of the ancient Elven Kingdom of [[Illefarn]] during the [[Age of Arcanum]] before the [[Calamity]]. During the [[Calamity]], an ancient force some of her people referred to as [[Tharizdun]] (Elven for "Endless Nothing"), was stirred and began corrupting, twisting, and empowering many of the gods, who eventually became the [[Betrayer Gods]]. One of these corrupted gods, the goddess [[Lolth]], known as the consort of [[Tharizdun]], established a stronghold in the bowels of the earth underneath where the heart of [[Illefarn]] was located. She began enticing and corrupting the [[Drow]] elves of [[Illefarn]] with promises of untapped power and knowledge, drawing the weak, power-hungry, and ambitious into her grasp. These devotees to [[Lolth]] called themselves the [[Children of Malice]].
- The Guide evacuated her people when she saw war was brewing in the [[Illefarn]] kingdom and she and her people fled to an island they found far into the [[Trackless Sea]] which her people later named [[Evermeet]].
- On the island of [[Evermeet]], The Guide first encountered what she referred to as a beacon. A great light appeared to her at the location of this beacon, asked her what its name was, and she named it [[Sirin]], which roughly translated means "purposeful light".
- The Guide was the first practitioner of [[Dunamancy]], the esoteric study of the nature of [[Dunamis]] and its threads through all schools of magic.

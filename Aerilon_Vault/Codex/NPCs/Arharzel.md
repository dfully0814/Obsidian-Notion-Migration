- Poem found on plaque outside at a mead hall in [[Good Mead]] below a large ferocious dragon in an attack stance that looks like it had just landed on a jagged and rocky surface

> In our childhood rumors ran
> Of a world beyond our door,
> Terrors to the life of man
> That the highroad held in store. He has no darting tongue or
> Teeth saw-edged, nor rattling scales
> No fire issues from his lungs,
> No black poison from his tail.
> He is a creature of dark air,
> Unsubstantial tossing forms, 
> Thunderclaps of man's despair 
> In mid-whirl of mental storms.
> And there's a true and only fiend
> Worse than prophets prophesy,
> Whose full powers to hurt are screened
> Lest the race of man should die.

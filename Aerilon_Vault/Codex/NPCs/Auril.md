> "Auril, the Mother of Creation"
> 
> We bow to She who wears the crown; Let the world shiver with dread. Clad in winter's whitest gown, Her snow enshrouds the dead. 
> 
> Her fury sheds but frozen tears as gray clouds issue forth Her wind across the wasteland shears bringing blizzards from the north. 
> 
> All the world in winter's white, sheathed in sleet and ice. Set upon never-ending night, She conjures paradise.
> 
> Behold her everlasting rime, see how it covers all. Weep not for those she traps in time behind Her glacial wall.
> 
> Sovereign of summer's lost, General of winter's war; Long live the One of cold and frost. May She reign forevermore.

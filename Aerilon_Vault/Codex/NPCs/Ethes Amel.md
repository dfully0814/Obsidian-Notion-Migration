# Summary
- Archmage of Cultivation in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]
- He is in charge of training the next generation mages and arcane specialist under the watchful eye of the [[Everwatchers]]
- One of the most distinguishing features of this mage is the magical artifact he carries with him at all times. It is a small, intricately crafted crystal that glows with an otherworldly light. This crystal is attuned to detect the presence of magical abilities in others, allowing the mage to sense the power of those around him. With a mere glance at someone, he can determine whether they possess magical talent or not, giving him a distinct advantage in any situation.
- Despite his power, the mage is calm and collected, always thinking before he acts. He speaks in a deep, resonant voice that commands respect and attention. Though he is often surrounded by other mages seeking his counsel or apprenticeship, he remains aloof and enigmatic, never revealing too much about himself or his past. Yet those who have earned his trust know that he is a kind and wise mentor, always willing to share his knowledge and help those in need.

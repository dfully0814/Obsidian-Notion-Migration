# Summary
- From the continent of [[Kerruma]]
# Motivations
- Funeral Rites are sacred and mean the most to me. I performed them very often for the [[Temple of the New Moon]]. The dead are burned in the golden brazier called [[The Asim]]. Their souls are then able to find eternal light with [[Horus]].
- Beauty. What is beautiful points us beyond itself toward what is true.
- I feel tremendous empathy for all who suffer.
# Relationships
- An [[Ujat]] saved myself and my mother ([[Qadira]]) from [[Set]] slavers. One of their number, [[Kadir]], gave me introduction to the [[Temple of the New Moon]]. There, I pledged myself to their education and training. There I met [[Farooq]] who became like a father to me. He introduced me to the ancient writings and customs of [[Horus]]. I knew that I was called to give my life to serve in his light.
- My mentor, [[Farooq]], willed my holy symbol to me upon his death. I carry no weapon of my own. Only the fire of my god will judge those who stand against me.
- The followers of [[Set]] defy the natural order and delve in dark magics. They have no honor and only seek destruction to remake the world in their image. [[Septizim Gamal]] cannot be allowed to raise the dead and dishonor the passage the gods create for all souls.
- Member of the [[Ha'Kari]] tribe
# Flaws
- I am dogmatic in my thoughts and philosophy.

# 5 Senses
- Armor has [[Kasika]] gems embedded within it.

# Notes
- My tenet:
	The Light of Dawn Will Come
	Do Not Fear the Cleansing Flame
	Only the Gods Will Weigh a Man’s Heart
- Prayer:
	To Horus who was born of Isis, I offer my praise.
	O son of Osiris, true heir to his throne,
	O saviour of your father, contender with your uncle,
	O Horus who joined the two great lands,
	who wears the double crown, O king of gods,
	O god of kings, I call to you, O Horus.
	Upholder of the right and the good, defender of order,
	guardian of Ma’at whose work is unending,
	I honor your constancy, I honor your might.
	I pray to you, O Horus, grant me your grace,
	grant me the gift of integrity, grant me the strength
	to do what must be done, the will to pursue
	the true and the just. Horus who was born of Isis,
	child born of magic, born of death into life,
	I call to you with reverence; I call to you with faith.

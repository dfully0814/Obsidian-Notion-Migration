# Summary
Elleanna was adopted at a young age by [[Tanavast Adamantus]] and [[Orrin Adamantus]]. [[Orrin Adamantus]] was not an overly affectionate mother but cared for her child as her own. [[Tanavast Adamantus]] was smitten by Ella and did everything he could to protect and provide for her as a solider in the [[Everwatch Knights]].

Years passed, and Ell grew up into a young teenager. One night, she was approached in a dream by a young girl with great power and might clothe her like a robe. The young girl said that Elleanna would one day do great things.

Ell woke up in a cold sweat, feeling different. as she looked down, she realized she had turned invisible, and screamed in fright. [[Tanavast Adamantus]] rushed in, and, seeing her bedclothes floating above an empty space, nearly attacked, until he heard her voice. Terrified, he told her to never use her abilities and to keep them secret, lest the family be torn apart. Frightened and guilt-ridden, she agreed and promise she wouldn't.

Weeks later, however, she gave in to the temptation and began practicing using her powers. Years passed, and she began to become very skilled in the use of her abilities, never letting anyone see her, remaining hidden in plain sight.

It was not until the 22nd birthday that she was finally caught. [[Tanavast Adamantus]], returning home early from a year-long deployment, went to find her in her room, and saw her appear out of thin air. He began to weep, asking what she had done, and begging her not to put him in the position she had placed him. She wept alongside him and asked for his forgiveness, and told him that he need not fear, for she was in control of it now. [[Tanavast Adamantus]] stoically raised his head, and told her that there was no such thing as someone who was in control of magic and that it was all dangerous. She submissively nodded and they left it at that, though she could tell that her father was concerned for her.

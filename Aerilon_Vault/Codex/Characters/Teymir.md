# Summary
I woke up 1 year ago face down on a drifting iceberg, freezing to death. I was picked up by a whaling ship out of [[Waterdeep]] and was taken there after a few weeks at sea. I didn't remember anything except my name. I don't know if I have always been "blind" or if it happened recently. I don't know what my tattoos mean or where I got them. I don't even know how old I am. I feel like I'm in my early twenties, but something deep inside feels...older. I am only beginning to understand the magic that courses wildly through my body.

Sometimes it has a mind of it's own. Sometimes I unintentionally almost kill myself, and others. Because of this, I keep moving. I stayed in [[Waterdeep]] for awhile, moving from street gang to criminal organization, always staying until something weird enough happened and I either left or was ushered out. I learned to live on the streets, though I quickly realized that the power I had meant I didn't need to stay there. One day, while wandering through [[Waterdeep]] a little over a year after my arrival, I noticed something during [[Shattering]], a holy day near beginning of the Spring celebrating the breaking up of the ice floes in the [[Uncharted North]]/beginning of the sailing season. My attention was drawn to the iceberg-breaking iconography and it drew me in given that it was one of the only clues to my past. That is when I met the leader of our cities’ cell, [[Sighi Thorgison]], and was recruited into the The [[Valkurians]]. The [[Valkurians]] have become the only family I have, and [[Shattering]] became a very important holiday for me. It seems to hold deep meaning given where I was discovered. I need to understand who I am, where I am from, what happened. What is the source of the power that plows through me? How do I control it?

# Motivations
- Freedom. Chains are meant to be broken, as are those who would forge them. All people should be free to define who they are and will become.

# Relationships
- Sponsored into the [[Valkurians]] by [[Azure Flint]]

# Flaws
- My memories are mostly gone and I will do almost anything to rediscover my past
- I hate being controlled, freedom is very important to me
- My magic is sometimes uncontrollable to me, and I get very angry when it causes me problems
- Loyalty is very important to me given my past, and I do not handle anything considered disloyalty well

# 5 Senses
- Bald and blindfolded, smooth, strikingly, gray features.
- Look rather young, maybe 23, but actually in my late 30s.
- Body covered in red tattooed lines.
- Wears dark maroon hooded robe open (scaled mail lined inside) with chest showing
- Golden bracer on left arm
- My sight - I see with my eyes closed - all color shimmery but otherwise normal, dark has no effect except a slight shadow. Bright light hurts my eyes even when closed so I cover my eyes during the day, appearing blind.
- My shield - when fist clenched a fanlike metal shield whips out with the faded image of a sun exploding on it

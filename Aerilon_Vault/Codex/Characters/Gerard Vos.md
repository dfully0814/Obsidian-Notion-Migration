# Summary
Gerard Vos, The military was going to be my life. I had intended to dedicate myself to it as my father had, and his father before him. I'm not sure if it was my decision, as there never seemed to be any question. It's probably for the best that he never lived to see what happened, but deep down I feel that he would understand. I was well into my career and had been promoted to sub-commander of a well respected division. An enviable position, to be sure, and I planned on enjoying my newfound authority and respect even if it meant dealing with the longtime, hard-nosed commander.

He had a bad reputation for "losing" subordinates to other positions or transfers, but I knew what I was getting into...what a fool I used to be. Despite what transpired, I feel no remorse for killing him. He tried to use his command for shall we say...less than honorable intentions. I expected him to be uncooperative when I attempted to relive him of command, but I didn't expect his refusal to come in the form of a quick draw of his sidearm. He knew how fast I was. He'd seen my marksman scores.

Maybe he thought to catch me off guard? Maybe he knew it was over and wanted an easy way out? Either way, my career was over. I chose the scenario where I kept my life. If my military experience had taught me one thing, it's that it's full of wasteful expenditure by inept keepers of purse strings. Find something they can't live without, and the possibilities are endless...

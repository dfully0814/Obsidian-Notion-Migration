# Summary
Spy. Thief. Criminal. Assassin. Why settle for one? Each has its own attractive aspects. Would be a shame to limit yourself. From a young age it was apparent that more was always better. If only 'more' wasn't so expensive. Perhaps if being a cobbler paid the same it would be more appealing, but a price can't be put on the intangibles that an 'alternative career choice' brings. Not to mention the pay...

The most valuable commodity, however, isn't gold or jewels but information. Not to say that the latter doesn't lead to the former. To the right buyer, certain information can be priceless. Invaluable information, however, rarely comes easily. Mastery of the necessary associated skills was paramount. A bribe here, a body there, and a whole world of possibilities opens before you.

The best part about dealing almost exclusively in sensitive information is that no one seems to want to report any associated crimes to the authorities. Public anonymity is indispensable in this profession. Royalty, governments, factions, guilds, peasants...I don't discriminate. If you have coin, I can procure almost anything you can imagine. A usurper assassinated? Done. Enemy battle plans? Easy. Rival put out of business? Naturally. A rare, precious you-name-it? Name the color.

No protection is perfect, no challenge insurmountable, nothing and no one is truly out of reach. When it comes to me, even I can't keep up with where the lies end and the truth begins anymore. I've passed myself off as both prince and pauper in the same afternoon. I change who I am like others change their clothing. Reading people has always been easy. Who they are. What they are thinking. Their planned actions and intentions...all clear as day . Just do or tell them what they want to hear and doors will open. Maybe they'll live to regret it, depends how I'm feeling.

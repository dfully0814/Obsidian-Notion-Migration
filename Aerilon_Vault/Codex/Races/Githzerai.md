# Description
An alien race lately found to have traveled to [[Toril]] in order to age, have children and build families. Little is known about them so far. 

The [[Githzerai]] live in a place they call [[Elall]], which in their language means "void" or "empty". It seems that there is no time in [[Elall]] so no [[Gith]] age. The [[Githzerai]] began to have a desire to have families after learning the concept from [[Netherese]] explorers who found their way to [[Elall]].  This desire to leave, caused a schism between the [[Githzerai]] and [[Githyanki]], leading to all out civil war.

Weapons with the automatic property require no priming or cocking for use, only pulling the trigger. Their trigger can be held down instead of being squeezed for each individual attack. While held down, the weapon discharges three bullets in quick succession. This is  called automatic shooting.  

Automatic shooting is an action that can only be taken  
if you have the Extra Attack class feature. You take the  
Attack action and roll a single attack with advantage. If  
it successfully strikes your target, roll twice the normal  
weapon damage dice and add the appropriate modifiers.  
This is particularly useful for targeting enemies under  
cover and firing through personal energy barriers and mesh  
armors.

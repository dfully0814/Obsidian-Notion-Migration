#recap 
# Last we left off...
After [[Galladon]] suddenly burst into the [[Cassalanter Mountain Villa]] with a flash and concussive blast and teleported [[Elleanna Corvus]] away, [[Elleanna Corvus]] felt a tremendous gravitational force on her body as she was catapulted through time and space, soon crashing on a hard and unforgiving polished marble floor. Around her were four marble pillars extended up to the ceiling another story up. There was a winding staircase on each side of the room leading up to a balcony on the second floor.  The room was lit with dim purple light from the purple flames that hover suspended in the middle of a series of decorative lanterns that hovered around the room and slowly moved about as though a gentle wind was aimlessly blowing them around. In the middle of the floor was a large dodecahedron built into the marble floor. 

[[Elleanna Corvus]] then heard echoing sound of the slow and deliberate footfalls of chained metal boots against marble from behind her. A low voice echoed, through the foyer, and said

> 15 years. 15 years I've counseled you. Trained you. Taught you how to survive. Watched over you. I vouched for you. When I found you, Alina told me you were too young and therefore couldn't be the one we were looking for, but I told you were naturally strong and that I saw something in you I've never seen in anyone else who has called out to us. I told her you'd be different. And you know, you were. You really were. And I'm sure you've often felt like I was asking too much of you. I'm sure I have. And it's because I've seen inside what you are truly capable of. I convinced Alina to send you on this mission. To give you a chance to prove your capabilities. To prove your strength and resolve that you so desperately begged me teach you (voice volume begins to build) WHEN YOUR MOTHER WAS PLOTTING AGAINST YOU TO TURN YOU OVER TO THE WATCHERS AND HAVE YOU CLEANSED. TO SEE TO IT THAT YOU ARE FOREVER TRAPPED INSIDE OF YOUR OWN BODY FULLY AWARE OF EVERYTHING AROUND, SCREAMING AND YET ABLE TO BE HEARD BY NO ONE. AND YOU CHOOSE TO ONCE AGAIN MAKE YOURSELF VULNERABLE ONCE AGAIN BY MAKING FRIENDS WITH THESE PEOPLE YOU WERE MEANT TO INFILTRATE AND FOLLOW. AND THE RESULT? I FIND YOU GROVELING ON YOUR KNEES LIKE A STRAY DOG BEGGING FOR SCRAPS!! (punches into the marble floor creating a large crack). AND NOT ONCE BUT TWICE SOMEONE HAS ALMOST MURDERED YOU IN COLD BLOOD WHO WERE MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP YOU TRAVEL WITH. YOU'VE EXPOSED YOUR INTENTIONS TO THEM. YOU'VE EXPOSED YOURSELF TO THEM. AND YOU'VE EXPOSED US TO THEM.
> Sit up and look at me. (as [[Galladon]] drew his sword). The last person I ever cared about died on his knees too. (tears start slowly rolling down the face). I thought you were gonna help me make it right. You were a little sister to me." (as [[Galladon]]'s sword lit up in purple flames and his eyes started glowing purple)

A regal and firm female voice then shouted from the second floor balcony, "[[Galladon]] stop. You know what she will become and you do not want that for her." A black figure with a porcelain white mask then started to hover along the marble floor from the second floor down the marble steps, making no sound of footfalls as a  shadowy essence billowed all around her like the train of a robe. As she got to the foyer she came near to you and reached out a gaunt hand that was almost pale white, caressing [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s lower jaw and lifted her head slightly to direct her gaze into the mute expression of the mask. "Let her speak," the female figure said.

With her head hung low, [[Elleanna Corvus]] contemplated her situation and asked [[The Guide]] what she wanted from her. [[The Guide]] shared with [[Elleanna Corvus]] how she and [[Galladon]] both saw such great potential in her from such an early age. She told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that she has a gift that not many are endowed with, but there are many who fear the gift she has and would seek to exploit it or worse. She shared that [[Galladon]] has grown to care for [[Elleanna Corvus]] and great deal and she should understand his angry from that standpoint, knowing that seeing [[Elleanna Corvus]] being careless is hard for him. She told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that this was her second chance and asked her what she would do with it, to which [[Elleanna Corvus]] responded, "I understand why I was so important to [[Galladon]]. I won't make the same mistake again."

[[The Guide]] continued by letting [[Elleanna Corvus]] know that her friends had abandoned the mission for the [[Sirin Beacons]] and had likely left entirely. She told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that the one person she could truly rely on to find her father is herself and not to doubt her strength and resolve.

Deciding to offer a connection of trust never before given, [[The Guide]] shared with [[Elleanna Corvus]] that [[Teymir]] is her son as she asked [[Elleanna Corvus]] to watch over him and see that no harm comes to him. She told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that she hasn't been able to discover more regarding how to reach him or how to explain it to him, knowing the damage it may cause. 

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] sat awe struck, [[Galladon]] looked down at her and said, "Don't do this again," to which [[Elleanna Corvus]] replied that she wouldn't and asked [[Galladon]] if he was up for some training. In response, he reached out his hand to her, helped her up and the two walked to an adjacent room.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]], [[Gerard Vos]], and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] arrived back to the [[Paramount]] where they encountered an individual named [[Asad Al-Nuri]], who said he was from the land of [[Kerruma]] from a tribe he called the [[Ha'Kari]]. He was a red-skinned Hobgoblin-like figure with leather armor containing dark orange gems assorted throughout. He said he was an associate of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] who did work for him in [[Kerruma]], lately having helped the [[Ha'Kari]] fortify the local temple in his city with a technology that sealed off the temple after a recent catastrophic event had occurred and several of his fellow warrior friends had been lost. He had received a distress call from the [[Paramount]] and believed that would be the first place to look to find [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] and report what had transpired in [[Kerruma]]. The party spent the next hour recounting a lot of the recent events including [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]'s death but didn't share how it had occurred. 

At that point, the sub reached just outside the perimeter of the storm when [[Teymir]] quickly popped the hatch and felt the warm sun on his face and the ocean spray for the first time in a while. Reluctant to face a brightness that he doesn't remember having ever seen before, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] remained in the ship until [[Asad Al-Nuri]] walked over to him, comforted him, and said that they could go together. He told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], "There is always one who watches. Let us bathe in his light." With that, the two climbed out of the hatch with [[Teymir]], seeing the magnanimous city of [[Neverwinter]] 1 mile in the distance on this clear day with a torrential storm just behind you cut off cleanly like an invisible wall holds it back.

And that's where we pick up...

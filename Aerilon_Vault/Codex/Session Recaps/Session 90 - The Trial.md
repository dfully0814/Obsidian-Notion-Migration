# Last we left off...
We began in time-worn attic [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Yang Tieh]] discovered to be the childhood room of [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] where [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] had discovered a strange black chest with the face of a dragon making up the front lock. Inside, he had found a handbreadth-long jagged black shard that emanated a cacophony of light whispers. The material reminded him of the material from which the walls of the city of [[Gloomwrought]] was built. After pocketing the shard, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] made their way back to meet up with the rest of the party.

Meanwhile, [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] conversed in the guest house dining room. [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] began to somewhat open up to [[Gerard Vos]] and shared that what he is now is thanks to his "dear old daddy." When [[Gerard Vos]] asked [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] what he intended to do with the beacon, [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] said he intended to destroy the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and undo what his father had done to him, not giving details into how that might be possible or how the beacon could contribute to that end.

The party then met up again after traveling through a secret trap door in the banquet kitchen of the main house. [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] were led to this area by the butler-like construct they came across in the ballroom of the main house. They watched as the construct reached the foot of the steps leading to a long hallway that connected to the wine cellar. As the construct reached the bottom step, its body wash suddenly crushed together by some unknown force as it fell to the ground in a clump of smashed metal.

[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began to investigate the walls on each side of the flight of steps when [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] brushed away layers of dust and debris from the walls to reveal rows of crimson-colored runes chiseled into the walls. Though he couldn't read them, [[Yang Tieh]] recognized these runes to be [[Draconic]], single symbols that can convey entire sentences of thought. [[Yang Tieh]] decided to touch his spear to some of the runes to see if there was some trap below the steps that they were powering. As he touched the tip of the spear to the runes, all the gears of his spear lit up and beginning violently spinning as electrical bursts began arcing out of each gear and the runes on the wall began to glow and pules a bright blue light, revealing many more runes lining the entirety of the long hallway leading to the wine cellar.

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] watched as [[Yang Tieh]] then fell over limply into the wall and onto the ground unconscious. The spear then remained fastened into the wall as though it had been plunged forcefully into the wall, seemingly continuing to draw energy from the runes in the wall or vice versa.

It was about this time when the rest of the party found [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] on the steps and saw [[Yang Tieh]] lying unconscious mid-way down the steps.

[[Yang Tieh]] awoke on a snow-covered stone bridge with what appeared to be a violent storm brewing overhead as heavy snowfall started covering him as he lay there. As he began feeling an imposing and violent presence around him, he heard the sound of a belabored voice that sounded as old as the world that boomed with the thunder in the sky as though they were one and the same, "I've been watching you for some time, [[Yang Tieh]], chosen of [[Auril]]. " [[Yang Tieh]] then asked who the entity was. With a continued belabored tone as though it was reaching across a vast distance it replied, "[[Arharzel]], general of the armies of the [[Pelor]] and destroyer of those who betrayed their kin." [[Yang Tieh]] then asked, "Where are you," to which it replied "Reduced to a shameful and feeble state by the masked ones." Insistently, the voice then cut in before [[Yang Tieh]] could ask anything else and said, "My time is short, [[Auril]] is not what she seems. She seeks freedom from her chains and has deceived many. You must be ready for what lies ahead. Prove your worth.....or die."

At this point, 10 wispy forms of lighting and wind appeared surrounding [[Yang Tieh]] and a battle ensued as [[Yang Tieh]] cut down one form after the other, watching as his spear violently powered up in a way he had never seen, giving him greatly enhanced abilities and speed he also has never experienced.

After he felled the last elemental creature, the spear began arcing even more violently, shooting out bolts of lightning all through the staircase as each party member attempted to jump out of the way, all successfully doing so except [[Elleanna Corvus]] who was hit by a bolt, knocking her unconscious next to [[Yang Tieh]] on the steps.

[[Yang Tieh]] watched as [[Elleanna Corvus]] suddenly appeared on the stone bridge next to him, moaning in pain and confused. 

And that's where we pick up...

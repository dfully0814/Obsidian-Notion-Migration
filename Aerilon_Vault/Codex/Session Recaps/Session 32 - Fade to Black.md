# Last we left off...
As the party and [[Jovi]] entered into the luxury town of [[Amphail]], you decided to have an evening of unwinding in the upscale nightclub, inn, and brothel known as the [[Stone Stallion]]. From the outside you saw the establishment to be a finely decorative, pastel orange, 2-story building with large white columns in the front. The building had a distinct U shape with finely sculpted horses affixed to heavy rosewood doors to be used as handles.

As you entered, finely set tables all about the room in front of you on both sides with white silken table cloths, a nice marble heart on one side of the room and a rosewood bar on the other. You saw what appeared to be a cowboy-themed band playing on a large stage in the front of the room. You saw two [[Everwatch Knights]] standing guard at the door carrying what looked like black and gold plated miniguns in their hands connected to a copper take by copper tubing.

Yang briefly stood around the bar to overhear conversation around him, picking up some local chatter about a noble family named the [[House Hemzar]] who recently moved into [[Amphail]] and many were speculating about what they were doing and why they had come.

[[Robinson Fellweather]] met a man at the bar named [[Alas Grahlund]] who he recognized as a member of one of the two most powerful noble houses in the [[Dessarin Valley]], [[House Grahlund]]. Robinson, knowing a good bit about the inner workings of the local nobility knew about the almost mythical stories of the ancient animosity between House Grahlund and [[House Cassalanter]], the valley's other most powerful noble house. Robinson shared with Alas about the [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]]'s destruction and the events near [[Thornhold]] as Alas mocked that the Cassalanter's had never built anything of any quality. Robison also discovered Alas was grieving over a lost love named Marge. Alas also told Robinson that he was a "black sheep" of the Grahlund family, having not been as successful as he was expected to be. He also told Robinson he owned a horse ranch in the hills and if he needed anything he could come see him.

Robinson later noticed a man watching your group from across the room after you found a table. He soon walked upstairs to your rooms where he found the man sitting in the room where [[Elleanna Corvus]] was also soundly sleeping, having received a sleeping tonic of some kind from him which he indicated later. Dressed in a full maroon suit vest, gold shoe buckle, maroon shoes, maroon top hate with clockwork designs sown into the hand and a mechanical monocle folded back from the right eye. Robinson learned his named was [[Aiden Zatchet]], the owner of The Stone Stallion. He asked Robinson and the group for help, explaining that a love of his named Marge had been "sold" to a competitor of his and he needed to get her back, explaining that she didn't likely love him too but it was his responsibility to do right by her. He proposed to find some help for Elleanna using his money and contacts in exchange for the service also threatening to expose her condition to the Everwatch Knights if you didn't comply.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] struck up a conversation with one of the leaders of the cowboy band named [[Sarah Roaringhorn]] who took an immediate curious interest in Yang, especially when she found out he was also interested in music. Yang joined the band on stage for the remainder of their set that night and almost instantly fit it, masterfully playing his flute in perfect key and step with all their songs. Afterward, Yang accompanied Sarah to the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]]. Teymir also indulged similar appetites back at the Stone Stallion.

As the late evening drew to a close, John attempted to bribe some information from the barkeep, learning that there seemed to be some kind of "knock down, drag out" brewing between the [[House Cassalanter]]'s and [[House Grahlund]]'s.

Ell indicated to Teymir that she was in almost constant burning pain and wouldn't be able to take it much longer.

The evening closed as Teymir sent [[Rushnaa]] on a task to [[Waterdeep]] to find [[Bo]], tell him he's done a great job watching his place in the Dock Ward, give him another 1 gold month's pay, and bring any and all news he has from Waterdeep.

We pick up the next morning in your rooms in the Stone Stallion while Yang wakes up in a room with Sarah in the Stag-Horned Flagon

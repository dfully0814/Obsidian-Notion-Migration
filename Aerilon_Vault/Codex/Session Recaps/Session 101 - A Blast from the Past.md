# Last we left off...

We began in [[The Moonstone Mask]] where [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] discussed some regarding her murder of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] concluded by warning [[Elleanna Corvus]] that she would be weighed in the scales and would be judged for her actions but that vengeance is not his to dispense at this time.

In [[The Ring Theater]], [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Sighi Thorgison]] made their way to their seats while [[Teymir]] began following a mysterious individual who carried an elongated metal case to the balcony of the theater and eventually into the VIP box. Stealthily, [[Teymir]] continued following the individual who soon made his way out of the VIP box and out to the second floor landing beneath some elaborate porticoes overlooking the stage. The figure then stopped at the end of the landing and sat down the case and waited. 

After turning himself invisible, [[Teymir]] snuck up behind the individual, grabbed the case, and teleported to the first floor and eventually made his way out of the theater, seeming to not alert any of the many [[Everwatch Knights]] around the theater on both floors. [[Teymir]] then took the case to an alleyway where he used a set of tools to successfully pick the lock on the case and open it. As the lock gave, he felt the case begin to vibrate. He opened the case to see a familiar pitch black sphere with what appeared to be a storm of purple lightning striking in increasingly quick intervals inside of it. [[Teymir]] recalled this to be the same device he encountered under [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]] left by [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], which triggered the earthquake and subsequent tidal wave that crashed into [[Thornhold]] and ultimately lead to the paranormal phenomena over the city.

Shocked at the sight, [[Teymir]] quickly picked up the case and ran toward the river that flows through the center of the city and slowly lowered the device into the water and proceeded to run back to the theater. As he approached the theater entrance, he felt a violent concussive blast underneath the earth itself in a wide surrounding area near the river, which included the theater. He quickly ran into the theater, shouted for [[Sighi Thorgison]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] as the group ran back out of the theater, accompanied by several bodyguards following [[Sighi Thorgison]]. 

Once outside, increasingly violent concussive blasts began to rush through the earth as the ground began tearing itself apart, at one point sending [[Sighi Thorgison]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] plummeting helplessly into a large fissure that had opened before they were saved by [[Teymir]] pulling them telekinetically across the divide safely onto the ground. The group then quickly got back together and began to quickly run from the city center as the ground continued exploded behind them.

Suddenly, [[Teymir]] found himself back in the theater standing behind the individual with the case. Confused and taken aback, he quickly grabbed the case again, made his way outside the theater and boarded the [[Phylund Skyrail]] and took it back to [[The Moonstone Mask]]. He found [[Asad Al-Nuri]], explained what had transpired, and explained what was contained in the long metal case now in his possession.

[[Sighi Thorgison]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] remained in [[The Ring Theater]] watching the ballet while [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to move invisibly into the theater in search of [[Jeremiah Phylund]]. She eventually found him and followed him up into the VIP box where she heard him discussing an important shipment of exotic animals coming in from [[Chult]]. As she listened, the room around her began to shimmer and shift as she began to feel light-headed and eventually drifted off where she experienced a series of memories. The first was that of her father clad in his [[Everwatch Knights]] armor, desperately pleading the following to a stern lieutenant sitting at his desk:

> Lieutenant, please, sir. I need some more amber. I'm....I'm starting to hear things. I....I'm solider, sir. I can't be like this. I can't take it anymore.

To which the lieutenant replied

> Seargent, your wife suspects your daughter is an apostate and until we confirm one way or the other, your suspension WILL CONTINUE.

Another memory flashed before her, one that she strangely never recalled actually happening. She and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] were running through the streets of [[Phandalin]] as he gripped her firmly by the arm. They stepped a few hundred feet from the [[Church of Bahamut]] as [[Tanavast Adamantus]] hurriedly said:

> "Ell, listen to me. You've got to go into the church and wait. I don't know how to explain."

To which [[Elleanna Corvus]] replied;

> "But dad, won't they be looking for me in there" It's Sunday. Mom will be in there.

[[Tanavast Adamantus]] concluded by replying:

> JUST GO. Everything will be okay.

A final memory flashed that depicted [[Tanavast Adamantus]] standing burdened and grieved before a black robed figure wearing a porcelain mask. "I don't know if I can go through with this," [[Tanavast Adamantus]] began. The robed figure compassionately responded, "Tanavast, your daughter is more important than you know. Your decision to remove her from your life is a sacrifice that will render its fruit a hundredfold in due time. You know she can't be with you. They'll find her. You don't want that. Acquire the ship that I told you and sail north."

[[Tanavast Adamantus]] responded by asking, "These people I'm supposed to meet. Why would they trust me?" The robed figure responded, "Just tell them you're a knight and fleeing [[Waterdeep]]. They want to help and they'll trust you. You do whatever necessary to protect them. Do you understand?" [[Tanavast Adamantus]] hesitated, thought deeply, and said, "Yes, I will. What about [[Leowin Moonflower]]?" The robed figured responded, "Her consecution is not complete so we will not yet know what the [[Shadovar]] have done." "Do you know what it's like to see the ones you love look you in the eye as though you never existed????" [[Tanavast Adamantus]] shouted as he began to cry.

The robed figure respond with a final comment, "Your sacrifice has been great [[Elestor]]. The [[Sirin]] will be reunited because of you."

The series of memories ended and [[Elleanna Corvus]] found herself back in the VIP box of [[The Ring Theater]].

And that's where we pick up....

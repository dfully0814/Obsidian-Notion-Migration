# Last we left off...

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] gathered herself after experiencing a series of [[Tanavast Adamantus]]'s memories, she attempted to salvage her efforts in [[The Ring Theater]] by continuing to listen to some of the conversations being had by the wealthy patrons in the VIP box, particularly those being lead by [[Jeremiah Phylund]]. [[Elleanna Corvus]] noticed that [[Jeremiah Phylund]] seemed to garner the respect and admiration of many of the patrons around him and seemed to also treat them with equal respect in kind. [[Elleanna Corvus]] noticed a woman sitting to Phylund's left wearing a crimson dress who seemed especially interested in him named [[Thilda]] who seemed to have some sort of interest in his import business. [[Elleanna Corvus]] also happened to catch one of the patron's say to Phylund, "[[Thera]] will make sure he has his mask." Lastly, [[Elleanna Corvus]] noticed that Phylund's bodyguards were all well-armed with automatic weapons and seemed to wield them in the theater with impunity.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]], [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], and [[Sighi Thorgison]] starting making their way away from [[The Ring Theater]] and back to [[The Moonstone Mask]] as [[Teymir]] began to share with [[Sighi Thorgison]] what he had seen happen to the city and tried his best to explain the nature of the device he had found. You went with [[Sighi Thorgison]] to the docks of the [[Protector's Enclave]] where you met [[Gilas]], an old gnomish man he seemed to know and had worked with for a long time. You boarded [[Gilas]]'s ferry and traveled across the [[Sea of Swords]] to the island where [[The Moonstone Mask]] is located.

As you traveled on the ferry, [[Sighi Thorgison]] shared that the failure of the mission with [[Leowin Moonflower]] has resulted in a token being dropped for him by the [[Valkurians]] as he has been viewed as a liability. He shared with you that he an important contact of the [[Thornhold]] cell of the [[Valkurians]] has been apprehended by the [[Everwatch Knights]] and taken to [[Blackstorm Prison]] far north of [[Luskan]] near the hamlet of [[Lonelywood]] in the [[Uncharted North]]. [[Sighi Thorgison]] shared that the prison is meant for those who are deemed some of the greatest threats to the realm. The shared that the man's name is [[Arles Benthey]], and the man is the brother of [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]], which has made him a suspect of great interest to the [[Everwatchers]]. He is being held as it was discovered he had some relationship to the [[Jade Lion]]. [[Sighi Thorgison]] is wanting to find from him who is the [[Harbormaster]] for the [[Thornhold]] cell of the [[Valkurians]]. He hopes to regroup the [[Valkurians]] together now that [[Waterdeep]] has been locked down in order to win back his credibility with the [[Valkurians]] as well as re-establish them and ensure that they are not discovered by the [[Everwatchers]]. [[Sighi Thorgison]] shared that his life likely depends on finding this man.

Meanwhile, as [[Elleanna Corvus]] began making her way back to [[The Moonstone Mask]] as well, she stopped on the roof of a building to meditate. She laid out several implements in front of her, including a small shard of [[Dragon Amber]] she has been carrying. She uttered a generic prayer of sorts, asking for help and waited. She watched as the entire city around her began to flicker and then change as her home of [[Phandalin]] began to form all around her. In the middle of the smoking ruins of the [[Church of Bahamut]], she saw two figures standing--[[Lyrala Xorlarrin]] and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] shrouded in dark armor and a black hood. 

[[Lyrala Xorlarrin]] began to condescend [[Elleanna Corvus]] and tell her that whatever she thought she was doing would not succeed, stating pridefully that she had already accomplished what she needed to. She invited [[Elleanna Corvus]] to "just go away." [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]] then transported [[Elleanna Corvus]] closer, brandished the broken and melted spear [[Yang Tieh]] once carried, and tossed it on the ground, saying, "One of your little friends tried to use this to kill me. Likely my foolish brother that told him of the [[Arc Infinitus]] and your foolish little sister's scheme to have some pack horse ferry an [[Arc Infinitus]] here. Dreadfully predictable and worst of all....boring." 

At this point, a shadowy form congealed out of the shadow all around her, long and slender. The form of [[Leowin Moonflower]] with hollowed out black eyes, a glowing tattoo of a dodecahedron in between her eyes, black lip stick and impossibly pale skin. The space around [[Elleanna Corvus]] then collapsed and she found herself back on the roof, panicked and paranoid as though a creature had begun to chase her. She raced back to [[The Moonstone Mask]], teleporting across the water, entered [[Asad Al-Nuri]]'s bedroom shouting that she was being chased and hunted. After a few moments of becoming increasingly distraught, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] magically calmed her, causing her to immediately pass out from exhaustion once whatever entity had influence over her had been removed. 

As the rest of the party gathered together again, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] managed to also magically remove whatever curse or hold was over [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] as [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] looked to [[Teymir]], recognizing him for the first time in years, and also feeling aware of himself and his faculties for the first time in over 5 years.

And that's where we pick up....

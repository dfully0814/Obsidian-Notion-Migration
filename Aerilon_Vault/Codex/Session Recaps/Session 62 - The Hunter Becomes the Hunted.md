#recap 
# Last we left off...
You began in your camp at the base of the [[Sword Mountains]] getting ready to rest for the evening. During [[Azure Flint]]'s watch with [[Gerard Vos]], he began to hear the sound of a deep battle cry coming from a patch of forest near your camp that he immediately recognized as that of [[Tarvhis Ormstead]], the gruff [[Goliath]] quartermaster of the [[Anguila]]. He watched as she ran out of a patch of forest nearby dragging a half-orc figure by his long black hair as he cursed her name.

She motioned for Azure to come meet her in the field as she stood aloof from the camp. Azure went out to meet her, soon followed by [[Yang Tieh]] who was also familiar with her from Yang's month long stint aboard the Anguila. The two saw that the half-orc figure had been bruised, broken, and bloodied. She shared with Azure that she had been following behind the group because she didn't trust the group Azure is traveling with and wanted to make sure he was safe. While tracking behind the group, she found this half-orc also tracking them and scouting their location as it changed. She said that he was a part of a group of local bounty hunters tracking your group and that the rest of the group was waiting in hiding in the Sword Mountains waiting on word from him that it would be a opportune time to ambush the party. He also told you the half-orc group had acquired arms from an [[Everwatchers]] weaponry cache and would be heavily armed if attacked in their encampment in the mountains. He also told Azure that they were collecting on a bounty that had been placed on [[Teymir]]'s head, dead or alive.

Yang then poured a vial of poison into the half-orc's mouth, placing his hand over the mouth and allowing the half-orc to slowly drown in the poison as it entered his lungs. Yang then took his axe and severed the half-orc's head from his body, placed it on a spear, and planted the spear in the camp to entice the rest of the bounty hunter group to track them. The party also intentionally left behind footprints in order to be easily followed. Tarvhis looked on somewhat taken aback and asked Azure if he could trust a man like that as Yang walked back to the camp carrying the severed head.

The party then set up an ambush several hours from the campsite and waited until the next day when the bounty hunting group came by their location. The party managed to successfully overcome the group as they past by a location your party had chosen as an advantageous place to attack them. Vos managed to disable the leader of the group, named [[Tormund]], and your party attempted to briefly interrogate him. While talking to him, Teymir noticed a similar necklace of red beads he had seen on the neck of [[Lucien Skyhorn]] back in [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]]. Teymir and Yang wrestled Tormund to the ground and managed to prevent him from placing the whole necklace of beads in his mouth.

The party continued on for the next 5 days and eventually saw the city of [[Phandalin]] in the distance. Hovering above the city was barge-like ship with a large rotating blue sign that read "[[Sea Maiden's Faire]]". After selling some of the extra horses you had at a local stable outside the city, you began to hear excited talk that the [[Day of Wonders]] parade was about to begin as you saw large groups of people hurrying through the gates of the city past [[Everwatch Knights]] who seemed to be surprisingly loose on who they were letting in.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦.

# Last we left off...

After talking with [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] and learning about [[The Investiture]] ceremony sacred to the [[Everwatch Knights]] and convincing the commander to wait to perform the ceremony until the remainder of his unit makes it safely to [[Luskan]], [[Teymir]] walked over to [[Elleanna Corvus]], who was still sleeping, woke her up, and shared with her what he had learned about [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] and [[The Investiture]]. He shared his respect for the commander and the way he and his soldiers fought, while also sharing he remains conflicted regarding how he feels about the knights, commenting that war is fought by "a lot of afraid people on both sides."

In response, [[Elleanna Corvus]] shared her familiarity with [[The Investiture]] as she had heard [[Tanavast Adamantus]] describe its importance to her. This conversation lead into [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] reflecting on the events surrounding [[Captain William Acox]] when [[Teymir]] killed the captain. Upon mention of his name, [[Elleanna Corvus]] pulled out the feather that she kept from his helmet and showed it to [[Teymir]], indicating her mutually conflicted feelings about the knights. [[Elleanna Corvus]] re-iterated her primary desire to find her father no matter the cost, and [[Teymir]] challenged [[Elleanna Corvus]] regarding what would happen if someone in the party got in the way of this pursuit, and [[Elleanna Corvus]] responded by saying, "I don't know."

[[Elleanna Corvus]] also brought up the what she had shared with [[Teymir]] regarding  [[The Guide]] being his mother, which he responded to by saying he hadn't had time to process it. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then shared with [[Teymir]] that she worries his past is darker than they even imagined as she continues to think about her vision of him and some of the other [[Scourgers]] killing people in the church before watching [[Teymir]] bring the ceiling of the building down. 

In response, [[Teymir]] shared with [[Elleanna Corvus]] for the first time how he had discovered from [[Lady Liane Antiet]] in the [[Everwatch Knights]] camp at the base of the [[House Xorlarrin Citadel]] that [[Gerard Vos]] had also been one of the [[Scourgers]] with [[Lady Liane Antiet]] recognized his face and referred to him as "Bren". They began to speculate regarding why [[Gerard Vos]] doesn't remember, and [[Elleanna Corvus]] asked [[Teymir]] if he was going to tell him. [[Teymir]] said he didn't know how to lay this on him also with what he's recently been through.

[[Teymir]] also told [[Elleanna Corvus]] about meeting his former mentor in the [[Scourgers]], [[Master Aegith Rane]], archmage of civic influence in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]].

After finishing their conversation, the party regrouped, discussed plans, and set out once again into the snow as [[Thryn]] lead the way.

After traveling for a little over 8 hours, a heavy blizzard began to blow in, and [[Thryn]] recommended the party stop for the night and make camp. The party then began to split up into watches. [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Teymir]], and [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] began the first watch.

During their watch, [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to have a heated conversation with the [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] trying to argue the pain and broken families the knights are creating by persecuting [[Apostates]], while [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] argued the devastating nature of magic in the wrong hands, when any seemingly well-meaning person could become an agent of mass destruction--voluntarily or involuntarily. Several times during the conversation, [[Teymir]] had to change the subject to divert [[Elleanna Corvus]] from potentially saying something she shouldn't. The conversation concluded when [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] realized what his soldiers had been through, and he couldn't ask them to do yet another hard thing by choosing one of them to take his sword and kill him during [[The Investiture]]. He looked to [[Teymir]] and told him that he wouldn't be here currently if [[Teymir]] hadn't stopped him from performing the ceremony prematurely. He then asked [[Teymir]] if he would perform the ceremony with him instead, which [[Teymir]] agreed to.

[[Gerard Vos]], [[Asad Al-Nuri]], and [[Professor Klaren Ray]] then began their watch together. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] discussed some with [[Gerard Vos]] what had occurred with [[Horus]] and shared with [[Gerard Vos]] that [[Horus]] must see some good in him to give him such a task. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] then began to pray for guidance regarding how best to guide [[Gerard Vos]] moving forward. [[Gerard Vos]] also talked some with [[Professor Klaren Ray]] regarding his suit and how it worked, finding out that his suit is fueled power cells filled with [[Blueshift]] fuel imported from [[Lantan]].

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]], [[Murlough Grahlund]], and [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] and [[Guardian Edward Jaxon]] took the final watch. [[Murlough Grahlund]] asked about [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s family and shared he was familiar with [[House Roaringhorn]], particularly their lucrative horse breeding businesses in the [[Dessarin Valley]]. They reminisced on the difficulty of growing up in a wealthy family, and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] shared that he hadn't been in contact with his in a long time. At this point, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began to hear a distant cry for help carried along with the frigid winds of the blizzard surrounding the camp in a very early morning hour. Cries for help became louder as laser blasts began to flash and criss-cross from the darkness of the trees in the distance.

And that's where we pick up....

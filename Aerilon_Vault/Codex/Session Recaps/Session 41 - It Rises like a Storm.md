# Last we left off...
After discussing some strategy, reminiscing about [[Azure Flint]], and anticipating the battle ahead, [[Klovag]] came back to escort you to the arena, accompanied by four white-skinned [[Draconic]] humanoid creatures. As you entered into the main square of the city you saw rows of [[Hobgoblin]] warriors in organized militaristic formations throughout the open market, along the overhead bridges, and along the upper tier walls. You heard only the sound of drum beats and ravenous shouting coming from the gigantic cavern gaining the arena.

As you entered an underground area beneath the arena, you were magically shackled to one of the four Hobgoblin brothers of [[Insk]] who you learned were [[Vrogar]], [[Sigvag]], [[Grozren]], and [[Ugrug]]. [[Teymir]] quickly recognized Grozren as a Hobgoblin warrior he attempted to strike a deal with the previous evening. You passed through a portal in front of you where you saw [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] up close for the first time, showing signs of decay in his neck and face dressed in a long woolen coat overlaying what appeared to be more refined leather and white woolen clothing with belts with large buckles and multiple pistol holsters. You watched as Blazbaard approached Grozren and said, "Say hello to Insk for me," and then lowly chuckled with a coarse and hurried inflections in his voice as though it was hard for him to breath.

The battle then began as the group of you were assaulted by flaming winged creatures rising up out of the lava bed beneath you and one large sentient flame that seemed to coalesce directly out of the bubbling of the fire of the lava.

A couple of you managed to break the shackles between yourselves at your Hobgoblin counterparts. When Sigvag broke his shackle with [[Yang Tieh]], Yang watched as he rushed to the closest pedestal outlined in glyphs, shooting him across the gap to the red obelisk.

You all then watched as [[Arharzel]], who was confined in a blue shimmering shield exhumed a second shattering torrent of energy from his mouth, freezing the entire blue shield around him and creating long icicles in it. Then with his large horned head, he gored the top of the shield, bursting it open and sending large shards of ice sailing in all directions.

And this is where we pick upâ€¦

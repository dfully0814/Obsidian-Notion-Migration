#recap 
# Last we left off...
A pregnant silence punctuated the clearing, interrupted only by the steady breathing of [[Azure Flint]] as he leaned over [[Teymir]]’s body, blood on his hands. Within moments an explosion of light bursts in front of Azure, [[Rushnaa]] appeared flying just above Teymir’s head with an ear-splitting screech, eyes burning into Azure’s. Azure stood up and walked off into the woods. The soft glow of Rushnaa is the only light in the clearing as she lands next to Teymir. [[Yang Tieh]] approached Teymir’s body and Rushnaa immediately intercepted a growl coming from [[Kaya]] behind. “He was my friend before he was yours,” [[Yang Tieh]] said, waiting. Rushnaa slowly floated back and landed opposite of Teymir and Yang knelt down, poking Teymir with his staff. After determining that Teymir was weak but still stable, Yang left him, investigating the plant creature’s remains and gathering a piece of the vine into his collection. Eventually Yang made his way to [[Elleanna Corvus]], caution and anger on his face. After tense introductions, Eleanna and Yang discussed the small bits of Eleanna’s mission she felt comfortable to share, eventually agreeing that they were both interested in research. Yang volunteered information about the vampire temple and their strange exit from it, which deeply interested Eleanna. She tried to convince Yang to take her there but Yang made clear that though she would be allowed to travel with them, she was not going to direct their choices in any way.

Eventually [[Elleanna Corvus]] made her way to the edge of the woods where [[Azure Flint]] was sitting. After a tense few words Eleanna asked Azure “Why did you do it?”. Azure was evasive and told Eleanna to go away. Eleanna said as she was leaving, “In my experience, you don’t do something like that to someone unless you care for them.” After about 2 hours, Eleanna noticed Rushnaa acting strange. She realized Rushnaa was pulling [[Teymir]]’s music box out of his pack and before she could react, Rushnaa opened it. The delicate song of the box cut into the silence of the forest for only a few seconds, at which time Eleanna cast an illusion to make the box appear as bread and the sound to be that of a hawk. But the deed was done, Teymir suddenly shot up onto his hands and knees, coughing and wheezing blood. After a moment, he sat up, grabbed the music box and said, “It’s ok Eleanna, you can stop the illusions.” Teymir sat for a moment listening to the box play in his hands and then slowly closed the box as Eleanna approached. She told Teymir that he should go and talk with Azure, but in his exhaustion Teymir simply told her he needed some space. Teymir then slowly removed the cloths covering his eyes revealing tatoos streaming out from the corners and swollen bruising.

After healing himself slightly he made his way slowly over to Yang. They sat in silence for a few moments, after which Teymir said, “We are Herald’s of the sea. We are supposed to be brothers.” They discussed the night’s events briefly and tensely, agreeing that there were few who could be trusted and they had to trust each other. Teymir asked if it was too much to expect that we should be able to trust each other to watch and guard while we sleep. After biting back a firmer response, Yang agreed that it was not too much to ask. Teymir sent Rushnaa to find [[Azure Flint]] and began to make his way there when he noticed Eleanna beginning to follow, to which he asked her to stay back. This was something he needed to do alone.

Breaking out of the woods about 30 ft down from where [[Azure Flint]] slept, [[Teymir]] looked up to see a bright moon in the sky. Staring for a moment he said, “Rushnaa, I can see into the deepest darkness, but I can’t see into Azure…It’s just too dark.” Azure unexpectedly replied that he could hear him, having set a spell to warn him of anyone coming. Teymir found that Azure was already drunk and sat in front of him, thinking a moment. “We used to be friends,” Teymir said. “What happened?” “The same thing that always happens, Teymir.” “Everything that is valuable or precious to me you have destroyed,” eventually saying, “I think I know why everyone you have ever loved has left you.” Azure questioned who had actually left who in those situations and began clapping saying sarcastically, “You figured it all out Teymir.” Teymir then removed the music box, saying, “This is the only link to my past, the only significant clue.” Then he set it down in front of Azure. Azure looked at it and then tried to give it back but Teymir stood up. “It’s in your hands now Azure. Show me what’s valuable to you.” As Teymir walked back into the woods, Azure sat humming the tune of the music box in the darkness.

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] continued her watch, she noticed a very slight and distant noise of what sounded like the stomping of something huge, or maybe thunder. She tries to wake [[Yang Tieh]] and even uses an illusion to try to convince him of the sound’s importance, but the illusion fails and she is humiliated. Hours later, as the party awakens they notice more patches of greyed, dying foliage in their clearing. [[Teymir]] walks to the tree line to look around and notices a huge plume of smoke rising on the distance. After calling Yang to bring his map, they decide it appears to be coming from [[Kheldell]]. Calling the group together, and sending Rushnaa to bring Azure, they discuss options and decide to head to Keldell stealthily in order to learn what happened. However, Rushnaa never returned. When Teymir and El go to investigate, Azure is gone. All that remains is Teymir’s music box and a note. As Eleanna gives Teymir some space, Teymir drops to his knees and reads, “Robinson is coming, he is a friend.” Teymir shakes his head and burns the note in frustration.

After telling the party what the note said, they decide to get moving toward Keldell. As they are leaving the forest, a squirrel ([[Pippal]], or his messenger) secretly approaches Yang and warns him, “Whatever you do, you cannot tell them about this tree,” emphasizing it’s importance. After a day’s travel, Rushnaa is sent ahead to scout Keldell and returns with terrible news: the town is obliterated, with most villagers dead or dying and huge craters littering the area. As Teymir hears the news during his first watch, his mind races. What is happening? What is going on in the world? He lays out things he has collected over the last two weeks, from the lighthouse, to the temple, to the music box…meditating, thinking, questioning. What do we know? What have we learned?

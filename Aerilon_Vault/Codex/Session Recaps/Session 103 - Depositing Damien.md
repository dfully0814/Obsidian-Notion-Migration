# Last we left off...

You began together in the room of [[The Moonstone Mask]] that [[Gerard Vos]] had previously rented for [[Damien]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] where both [[Damien]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] now lay unconscious as the rest of the party planned what to do next. 

Having become aware of himself and [[Teymir]] for the first time in over 5 years, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] immediately exclaimed, "[[Kerth Roaringhorn]], where is he?" as he remembered [[Sighi Thorgison]] mentioning him back in [[The Ring Theater]]. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] ran outside and down to the island dock where the party had left [[Sighi Thorgison]] aboard [[Gilas]]'s ferry. He began to urgently inquire regarding [[Kerth Roaringhorn]]'s whereabouts. [[Sighi Thorgison]] told him that the last location he was able to track [[Kerth Roaringhorn]] was [[Yartar]] where [[Kerth Roaringhorn]] where he has been working off a debt to a wealthy and dangerous man known as [[Atrix]], known to run a widespread gambling ring in the northern [[Dessarin Valley]].

[[Sighi Thorgison]] shared that he would have sent men in to extract [[Kerth Roaringhorn]] already, but his hands are tied because he has had violent turf disputes with [[Atrix]] already that have almost exposed the [[Valkurians]] and put many of his men in danger as well as [[Atrix]]'s operations. When the two realized their mutually assured destruction if they continued in their turf disputes, they agreed to a truce whereby the two parties would split the [[Dessarin Valley]]--[[Atrix]] to the North and [[Sighi Thorgison]] to the South. The two agreed to stay out of the business dealings and operations on each turf. Therefore, [[Sighi Thorgison]] shared that he's unable to help [[Kerth Roaringhorn]].

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] then rejoined the party in [[The Moonstone Mask]] where you discussed what to do next. You eventually decided that you would first travel back to the submarine and big up some of your gear while also depositing the black sphere onto the sub and submerge 450ft deep 2 miles off shore. You also decided you would seek [[Sighi Thorgison]]'s help to see if there were somewhere he could hide [[Damien]] as you travel north to [[Luskan]] to either see to [[Gerard Vos]]' affairs or travel even further to [[Blackstorm Prison]] to get information from [[Arles Benthey]] regarding the identity of the [[Thornhold]] cell [[Harbormaster]] and possibly extract him if possible to gain credibility with [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] and also avoid any further interrogation that might lead to the exposure of the [[Valkurians]].

Once you made your plans, [[Elleanna Corvus]] teleported [[Damien]] down to the island docks where [[Teymir]] had already begun speaking with [[Sighi Thorgison]]. When [[Sighi Thorgison]] saw an unconscious [[Everwatcher]] lying there on the ground, he became increasingly incensed as to the threat that this young man posed to the [[Valkurians]]. He began to adamantly and angrily tell [[Teymir]] that his hands were tied and there's nothing he could do as it would likely lead to the destruction of what little credibility he had left with the remaining contacts he has left, especially after the fiasco with [[Leowin Moonflower]]. 

[[Sighi Thorgison]] and [[Teymir]] began to hotly exchange words, [[Sighi Thorgison]] beginning to question some of [[Teymir]]'s loyalty and eventually telling [[Teymir]] he would help if he could as tensions began to calm. However, tensions continued to also heat up between [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Sighi Thorgison]] when it became clear [[Asad Al-Nuri]] would not consider eliminating [[Damien]] if the need arose as [[Sighi Thorgison]] began to ask [[Teymir]] in Thieves Cant if he was willing to do what was necessary and cut both of these men loose if it meant danger to the [[Valkurians]].

As [[Asad Al-Nuri]] mentioned how the "One over all" will provide protection, [[Sighi Thorgison]] responded that he doesn't need protection from the "one over all," it needs protection from him and frustratingly quipped to [[Teymir]] that [[Asad Al-Nuri]] that these "religious types" don't live in the real world and are only gonna bring greater risk to the journey ahead.

After some more debating and wringing of the hands to determine what to do with [[Damien]], [[Asad Al-Nuri]] happened to notice a distant uninhabited island 400 ft north of [[The Moonstone Mask]] island. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] then summoned a humanoid celestial creature out at the docks and commanded it to fly [[Damien]] to the island and drop him off. 

At this point, you have gathered your gear from the submarine and deposited [[Damien]] on the island. You have now made your way back to [[Sighi Thorgison]] at the docks of [[The Moonstone Mask]] island.

And that's where we pick up...

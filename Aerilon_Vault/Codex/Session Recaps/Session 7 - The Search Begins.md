# Last we left off...

After converging upon the [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]] in search of a lost and valuable asset that belongs to the [[Valkurians]], [[Yang Tieh]], [[Azure Flint]], and [[Teymir]] found themselves immediately locked into battle across various floors and rooms of the lighthouse interior. On the top balcony floor, Azure continued his confrontation with a mysterious Dwarven figure with dark ashen gray skin, white eyes, a mo-hawk of sharply spike white hair, and a large stone sword.

Azure succeeded in preventing the dwarf from wrapping his hands fully around the light source like he had done, and after dealing several critical blows to the creature, soon witnessed the dwarf begin to grow twice its size, giving off the sounds of grinding boulders. As the now giant dwarven creature took a massive swing at Azure, missing him and cleaving through the light source glass and stone enclosure, Azure capitalized by jamming climbing pitons into its back, surprisingly realizing after having done so that he had dealt the killing blow to the creature.

After searching the creature's various body parts that had been dislodged from one another from the impact into the stone enclosure, Azure found the number **5431** chiseled onto the back of the neck of the head and under it, the same symbol engraved onto the lyre Teymir bought from the merchant in [[Waterdeep]]. Meanwhile, in the main hall of the lighthouse, after taking a very damaging blow from the [[Drow]]'s short sword that caused a black and viscous liquid to begin seeping from his chest, Teymir dealt several more damaging blows to the Drow, eventually killing him and taking the orb objects remaining on his belt and his short sword and crossbow.

On the second floor, Yang and [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] continued engaging the second dwarven creature. Yang attempted to communicate with him in Dwarvish, resulting in the creature mentioning it was a slave before ferociously attacking **Yang** again. After dealing several speedy and precise blows to the creature, **Teymir** was able to flank the creature from behind, dealing the killing blow.

While the party was investigating the **Main Hall** of the lighthouse, you began to hear a scuffle on the second floor between **Captain Moonlight** and [[Lucien Skyhorn]], who you left together to proceed downstairs. As **Teymir** ran up to investigate, he witnessed **Lucien** attempting to push a necklace of red beads into his mouth and **Moonlight** trying to stop him. Overcoming her and **Teymir's** mage hand with the primal strength coming from panic and passion, **Lucien** was lost in whirlwind of fire and ash.

Moonlight later recalled to **Teymir** how once **Lucien** woke up, he began to repeat I'm sorry Miriam ([[Miriam Skyhorn]])" over and over and say how you shouldn't have come. The party then followed **Yang** back down to the **Main Hall** to the **Store Room** where **Yang** revealed a secret trap door in the floor sealed by mysterious glyphs that were dispelled when he bent over it and quietly spoke the word **"Miriam"**. The trap door opened of its own accord revealing deep darkness below as the ground began to rumble and the strange heat intensified.

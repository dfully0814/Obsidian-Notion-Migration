#recap 
# Last we left off...

The party picked up in the ceremonial room examining the vine-like from above the doorway, which I clarified was indeed more like a form of organic vines and not an ooze-like creature. After inspecting it more thoroughly, [[Azure Flint]] noticed a few budding flowers on some of the vines. Attempting to pluck one of the flowers from the mass, [[Yang Tieh]] extended his hand out, allowing one of the vines to slowly wrap around his hand, vicariously sending lightning sparks into the vine, seemingly causing the vine to grow in size slightly. As he pulled the flower from the mass of vines, he noticed that the flower seemed to detach from the mass more like it wasn't originally part of the mass of vines since it didn't separate with a resistant pull. Venturing further, the party came across a 12ft. tall statue they accidentally toppled over, acquiring a stone-made great sword, a few polished obsidian gemstones, and uncovering a hidden crawl space behind where the statue was standing.

Within the crawl space, [[Teymir]] saw a protruding hand exposed that was later revealed to be a stone human figure lying face-first dressed in tribal garb. Using his arcane ability to understand languages, Teymir deciphered a message haphazardly scratched into the dirt floor of the crawl space near the stone body and was able to discern and singular idea from the pictographic message, "sacrifice in order to protect." He also took note of a vertical oval symbol that looked somewhat like an eye written a few times that didn't seem to factor into the direct meaning of the message. The group encountered another room filled with about 20ft of water, very minimalistic in design. The group entered the room on a ledge overlooking the water below.

Jumping into the water, [[Azure Flint]] made his way to the door opposite the ledge, opening it, and was sucked out of the room into the adjoining hallway. Scoping out the room as it drained, the rest of the group noticed how strange it was that there was a ledge high above the room below with no ladder or other way down, the group eventually realizing this reminded them somewhat of some kind of crude prison. In another flooded ceremonial-like room with large columns connected from the floor to the ceiling, Azure walked into the water below, weighing down his boots and walking along the floor of the room while tied with a room to [[Teymir]] who was swimming on the surface of the water.

While below the water he began seeing a strange greenish hue floating and bobbing throughout the water and then seeing a few humanoid forms fluidly swimming through the water with what looked like seaweed-like material trailing from their bodies, periodically appearing and disappearing in the dark muddy water. Azure began hearing a melodic voice speaking to him asking him for an offering. When he asked the voice, "Who are you?", the voice responded, "We are you." Suddenly, Azure heard the voice of someone whom he once loved and was separated from after they grew apart. Taken aback in a way he hasn't been in a while, Azure asked the voice what it wanted, to which it responded, "To know..." The voice then told Azure that if he would smash the four stone human figures lying together on the floor, which Azure realized he had stumbled over, he would be granted a great treasure. Swimming up and casting a powerful shatter spell, Azure broke all the stone figures.

At that point, a subtle light began glowing, leading him to the other side of the room to a small niche in the wall where he found an amulet bearing the same vertical oval symbol Teymir saw in the craw space markings, some leather bracers with tribal markings, and a stone dagger. Teymir then attempted to figure out what Azure had discovered and what happened below the water, which Azure successfully most obscured through keen deception and misdirection. When he attempted to grab the amulet from Azure's neck, Teymir was unable to grab the amulet, watching as his hand was blocked by some kind of invisible barrier. As Azure attempted to grab the amulet, he found himself also unable to grab it. Lastly, you found yourselves at another set of bronze double doors, John Smith able to hear the melodic smothered hum of singing on the other side.

As Teymir burst through the doors into a room made to look like a small beach where the ceiling looked like a night sky, Teymir unable to see any stone on the ceiling but an endless void. As the party burst into the room, John Smith was able to see a watery figure dive into the water and disappear, creating no ripples in the water as if the figure became the water. The water then took on the same greenish glowing hue all throughout. Teymir began investigating the water, noticing that there were small lapping waves like an ocean and that the water was about 12 ft. deep. Dipping his head into the water, Teymir began to hear the beautiful melodic song of a female voice that he noticed was singing a foreign language that he was able to understand with his comprehend languages spell still active.

The song was about a longing for home, cerulean crystalline beaches, birds of all colors, clear skies, and deep greenery. Teymir remembered this description as being very similar to [[Leowin Moonflower]]'s description of her home while on the [[Dawn Chaser]]. [[Yang Tieh]] then placed his hands into the water, sending jolts of electricity through it, resulting in an amorphous aquatic form rising up out of the water, slowly taking on the detail of an elven-looking female figure as the sounds of swirling water and breeze blow from her. Looking at Yang, she said "Offer your secret Yang Tieh," in a language, Yang didn't understand but Teymir did, so Teymir began relaying her messages to Yang. Speaking to Yang, she said, "You failed your mission..." Presuming she was speaking about Leowin, Yang pushed back against the assumption that his mission had already failed, to which the watery figure responded, "The lich was your mission was it not?" as silvery scoffing laughter began echoing around the room. Enraged in a way no one has yet seen him, Yang threw an electrified punch at the watery form as 3 shadowy figures congealed out of the essence around youâ€¦

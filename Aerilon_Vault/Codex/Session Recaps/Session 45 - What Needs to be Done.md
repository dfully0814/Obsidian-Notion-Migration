#recap 
# Last we left off...
As the white-skinned [[Draconic]] creatures began breaking into [[Klovag]]'s home where [[John Smith]], [[Robinson Fellweather]], and [[Yang Tieh]] were currently trapped, [[Teymir]] teleported into the room through the wall and then used his ring of rock magic to create a doorway in the wall of the room and successfully guided that other three through the wall into the adjoining room before sealing the wall. A chase began as more draconic creatures entered various floors of the [[Baraskur]] residence area, checking room by room for the party. Teymir once again was able to use his ring to open the floor above and everyone climbed through the floor to an adjacent room on the 3rd floor, seeing two Hobgolin children who Yang quickly knocked unconscious.

Your group of four eventually made your way onto the 2nd floor bridge extending out into the city square, Yang and John riding [[Kaya]] and Robinson quickly keeping in stride after casting an expeditious retreat spell. As you entered out onto the bridge, Yang saw [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]], the two Draconic guards, and [[Elleanna Corvus]] standing out on the balcony of his living quarters. Yang quickly poured a flying potion into Kaya's mouth, sending him soaring into the air in Blazbaard's direction with John Smith still riding on the back. Yang directed Kaya to pounce on Blazbaard as he soared over the balcony into the living quarters. Anticipating Kaya's attack, Blazbaard side-stepped the attack, spun around and created 3 violet tethers from his dagger into Yang, John Smith, and Ell simultaneously. Ell quickly deescalated the tense stand-off by telling Yang she had made a deal with Blazbaard and to hear him out. Yang then looked around Blazbaard's quarters, following a hint of fresh blood that he had detected and found Klovag's severed head sitting on the inn table text to Blazbaard's couch.

Blazbaard confirmed he and Ell had made a deal but mentioned that because of the theatrics earlier, his ask had increased. He also mentioned to Yang he believes Kwalish was working on experimental technology for seafaring vessels. He told Yang that the party also needed to bring back the schematics Kwalish was working on for his new technology. He told you that if you were able to bring back the schematics he would split the take of energy cells you discover 50/50, if not he would split them 70/30. He also mentioned that the [[Red Flayers]] who have been recently taken, were actually not taken but walked away on their own in the night, but he has convinced the Red Flayers that [[Oknag the Mad]] has taken them in order to give them a known enemy to fight.

You then exited the living quarters, some of you back over the balcony, but Ell left through the door, walking back down the tunnel where she saw Teymir standing at the end of the hall. Teymir asked Ell if she had killed Klovag, looking disappointed and trying to understand what happened. Ell told Teymir that she killed Klovag because she knew that he wouldn't. She also indicated that Blazbaard seems to be the one more well-connected and able to provide answers, not Klovag who has barely ever left the mountains. She also told Teymir that it was for his own good that she keep him at arms length. As Teymir walked away, he heard Ell begin crying, at which point he turned around and said, "That's the real Ell," and then attempted to comfort Ell by telling her the real Ell was the one he saw try to save Klovag and that he understand she killed him because she realized she had no other choice after the illusion failed.

You then rested through the night and was met by Blazbaard's lieutenant [[Krol]] the next morning to be outfitted for the journey ahead. He took you to a hallway on the first tier of the city. The hallway was lined with Draconic guards and you saw a row of mechanical armor suits sitting inset into 6 wall cutouts at the end of the hallway. Krol mentioned that the 6th set was the one used in the arena yesterday and the arena battles are how they often test new sets of armor to in order to fine-tune and stabilize them. You entered the stable suits of armor without issue and began your 4-hour journey to the [[Moon Pass]]. Krol mentioned to you that they have been sending scouts for a few months to monitor the activity on the island and lately they have not seen any activity at all.

You made it back outside for the first time in a few days on a cliff ledge overlooking the Moon Pass, which appeared to be a bowl-like valley created by the crash of the [[Netherese]] vessel. Using the jet boosters on the feet of your armor, you all began gliding across the 300ft gap between the cliff edge and island floating in the middle upheld by large jet engines currently burning red-hot and keeping the island aloft. You began experiencing stimuli from your most treasured memories as you flew. You landed on the surface of the snow-covered island and immediately saw blue Draconic [[Hobgoblin]] bodies scattered around the landing area, bearing piercing, slashing, and bite wounds. Yang determined that it looked like a battle had taken place. As you began to look around, you decided to start exploring the island further.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

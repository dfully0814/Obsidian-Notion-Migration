#recap 
# Last we left off...
You began at around 6pm on Friday in the city of [[Neverwinter]] in one of your rooms in [[The Moonstone Mask]] to begin making your plans regarding which mission to tackle next--framing [[Jeremiah Phylund]] for the tragedies that befell the [[Vos Industries]] near [[Luskan]], an unknown task [[Sighi Thorgison]] has for [[Teymir]] as payment for a cloak [[Teymir]] was interested in inside of [[The Northern Exchange]], and making a play to acquire one of the [[Sirin Beacons]] which [[Asad Al-Nuri]] learned from [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] resides in the [[Vault of Tomes]] along with some unknown phenomenon that is seemingly affecting [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]].

As you made your plans, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] sat in the lobby of [[The Moonstone Mask]] with [[Damien]] as [[Damien]] continued silently staring cautiously at [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] across the table. After a period of time, [[Damien]] asked [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], "What did you do to me? Why do I keep forgetting things since I met you?" [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began to unsuccessfully talk [[Damien]] down as [[Damien]] instead seemed to become increasingly conflicted and nervous. At one point, [[Damien]] stood and said, "I have to go." In response, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] placed his hand on [[Damien]]'s shoulder to try and stop him and ask what was wrong. As [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] placed his hand on [[Damien]]'s shoulder, he watched as [[Damien]] once again fell unconscious to the ground. Worried over the many onlookers around the room, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] quickly picked [[Damien]] up and made his way upstairs to one of the rooms where the rest of the party had just concluded discussing plans for what's next.

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] entered the room with [[Damien]]'s limp body over his shoulder, placed him on the ground, and explained to everyone what had transpired. Interested to understood more about what was going on, [[Teymir]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] both asked [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] to shake hands. [[Teymir]] noticed no difference, while [[Asad Al-Nuri]] also fell unconscious. The party decided to quickly move [[Asad Al-Nuri]] to the room [[Gerard Vos]] had purchased for [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]] which was across the hall, leaving [[Damien]] in the current room, leaving [[Gerard Vos]] alone to watch over [[Damien]] while you tended to [[Asad Al-Nuri]].

As [[Asad Al-Nuri]] lay unconscious, [[Elleanna Corvus]] attempted to peer into his memories to try and understand what might be happening to him. As she reached out to him, she experienced a void, a nothingness, return to her unlike anything she'd ever experienced as though there was a void of any memory at all. She became increasingly uneasy as she stood there in this vapid state when she suddenly heard the faint sound of her father [[Tanavast Adamantus]]'s voice whisper her name. She then pressed in harder toward [[Asad Al-Nuri]]'s memories when you all heard a violent shout from the opposite room, shouting [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s name--a voice [[Elleanna Corvus]] immediately recognized as [[Tanavast Adamantus]]'s. 

The voice came out of [[Damien]]'s mouth as [[Gerard Vos]] watched his body shoot upward as [[Damien]] began to violently screech and tear into the wood panels of the room with his hands. When [[Gerard Vos]] tried to stop him, [[Damien]] attacked him, knocked him to the ground, and  swing a nailed wooden board into [[Gerard Vos]]'s forearm. [[Gerard Vos]] responded by a firing a single shot into [[Damien]]'s stomach, when [[Damien]] fell limp to the floor and began to bleed profusely.

The party rushed over to the room where [[Elleanna Corvus]] attempted to sense [[Damien]]'s memories, noticing the same emptiness from him. Frustrated and seemingly becoming desperate to understand what was going on, she grabbed [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s hand when a bright flash of light burst from between their hands and a illusory duplicate of [[Elleanna Corvus]] manifested next to her and began to attack the party. After a few moments, the party dispatched the duplicate and [[Teymir]] began to intensely question what [[Elleanna Corvus]] was doing, understanding that the situation was quickly spiraling out of control. 

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] then took [[Damien]] over to their room and began treating his gunshot wound and magically cleaning his robes to hide any trace of what had transpired. He then laid [[Damien]] in the bed and watched over him while the rest of the party regrouped. As he watched over [[Damien]], [[Damien]] began to come into consciousness in a state of shock and panic at the shredded state of his hands and fingers and the sharp pain wracking his whole body. Between labored breaths, fear-filled breaths, [[Damien]] said, "I have to tell them about you....I have to. What's happening to. What's....happening...[[Helm]] be merciful to me.....be merciful."

Realizing that the time to meet [[Sighi Thorgison]] in [[The Ring Theater]] was drawing near, the rest of the party pulled themselves together and got ready to leave [[The Moonstone Mask]], leaving [[Damien]] in the care of [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Gerard Vos]] to try and talk to [[Ophala Marget]] and get out ahead of what had just transpired, but not before [[Elleanna Corvus]] accidentally let slip that she was the one who had murdered [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] and a confrontation between the two ensued.

[[Elleanna Corvus]] intends to look for [[Jeremiah Phylund]] in the theater to see what he looks like while [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Teymir]] meet with [[Sighi Thorgison]]. As you entered the theater, you found [[Sighi Thorgison]] standing in the lobby speaking with various patrons. When he saw you, he was overjoyed and immediately addressed [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] first, saying:

> By Helm's holy ass, I never thought I'd see the likes of you again. Nothing makes an evening feel as smooth as your grandmother's hand-churned buttermilk like when brothers reunite after a shit ton of misfortune.

As [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began talking to [[Sighi Thorgison]], [[Sighi Thorgison]] quickly noticed something was off about [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] as [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began speaking in ambiguous terms and didn't seem like the [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] who [[Sighi Thorgison]] remembered. As the two spoke briefly in the lobby, [[Teymir]] noticed a man in fine suite carrying an elongate abnormally-sized case up the stairs to the balcony area of the theater and he walked away to follow him.

And that's where we pick up....

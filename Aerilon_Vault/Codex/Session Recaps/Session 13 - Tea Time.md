# Last we left off...
The party picked up the chase of 3 ruffian men through the jungle at an uninhabited area of The [[Sword Coast]]. [[Teymir]] and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] successfully subdued the men when Teymir cast a Darkness spell that engulfed two of the men and Tanavast successfully speared the other man to the ground. The men were terrified and told Teymir that they would take him to the "captain" and he would sort everything out and they didn't mean any harm. Teymir and Tanavast lead the men back to the shore to deliberate.

Teymir and [[John Smith]] decided to scout a clearing area Teymir saw during the chase and the 4 men told him was the site of a dig that was occurring that they were hired to protect. When they arrived at the campsite, John Smith heard a mechanical device behind him held by a 7ft tall Hippopotamus-like humanoid figure wearing 18 Century British Navy clothing and a monocle in his eye. He invited the party to sit for tea, offering some more noble clothing to [[Yang Tieh]], who he seemed to pity in a condescending way regarding his simple and "drab" clothing.

He told the players that he was a member of the [[Harpers]] and had been dispatched along with a company of mercenaries to this area of The Sword Coast in search of an ancient shrine dedicated to a lost vampire god of the underworld during the reign of the ancient Elven empire of [[Illefarn]]. He mentioned that the Harpers are interested in recovering [[Netherese]] artifacts believed to be buried somewhere in the shrine to catalog and keep out of the hands of malicious parties that might abuse them. He also mentioned that the Harpers have a somewhat tense relationship with the [[Everwatchers]], the Everwatchers being mistrusting about the Harpers cataloging of magical artifacts and people.

He told the party that if they would offer to help him retrieve these artifacts from the shrine and would conduct themselves honorably, he would offer his help to them in whatever task the party is undertaking as well as put in a good word with a Harpers contact in the city of [[Luskan]] up north. The party is now discussing what to do with [[Leowin Moonflower]]. You have discussed disguising Leowin in some way and bringing her with you and calling her "[[Paige]]". [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] has told you that you are welcome to rest at the camp before venturing down into the hole.

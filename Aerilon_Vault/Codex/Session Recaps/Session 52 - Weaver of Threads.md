Following your confrontation with a group of [[Everwatch Knights]] in [[Amphail]] and successfully escaping the city, you found yourselves separated from one another and on the run. After [[Rushnaa]] flew back to [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] following her brief conversation with [[Robinson Fellweather]], Robinson began hunting for wolves in the snowy forest east of Amphail. He managed to successfully trap two wolves in a circle of ice and began eating them after donning his metallic mask.

While surveying the perimeter with his detached eye, Robinson saw [[Yang Tieh]] making his way north into the forest from the south. He lead Yang back to his location in the forest using the detached eye where Yang saw Robinson feeding on the body of one of the wolves.

Robinson and Yang then mounted Robinson's boar and began making their way to the home of [[Alas Grahlund]], a noble Robinson met at the bar of the [[Stone Stallion]] in Amphail. The two eventually made it to Grahlund's country estate where they witnessed the beginning of what appeared to be a formal party as various noble figures, mostly Grahlund but also others, were congregating on the grounds and making their way into Alas' home. Alas heartily greeted Robinson and Yang when he saw them walking toward the house, invited them in, and gave them both nice clothing to wear. To Robinson, he gave a caplet of lynx fur and a crimson suit and pants, black dress shirt and dress shoes and to Yang he gave decorated Japanese black and white dress robes.

While talking over drinks, Alas caught up with Robinson and Yang regarding their recent adventures. Realizing their capabilities, Alas invited them into his office of his home where he asked them for help hunting down [[Aiden Zatchet]] who he believes to be complicit in the servitude of his love Marge to Captain [[Captain Riffolk Salte]]. He told them that they would need to acquire from him [[Marge]]'s location and then he requested that they delay killing him until he is able to be there to see it. He also told them that Zatchet was originally [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] and he believes that Zatchet and some others around him are involved in mysterious and nefarious schemes that would be a major red flag for the Everwatch Knights. He mentioned that he and some of his hired hands have acquired shipments from the coast that were overseen by Zatchet. In those shipments were found various old books in unknown languages and strange artifacts. He requested that before acquiring and killing Zatchet that you find a way to expose his dealings to the [[Everwatchers]] so that the [[House Cassalanter]] family will be under the watchful eye of the Everwatchers. He also told you that you were welcome to stay in his home until you were ready to embark on your journey to the coast, where some of his spies reported his last known location to be near the [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]].

Meanwhile, Teymir and Ell began to process much of what has been found and what has occurred up to this point. Teymir shared with Ell everything that occurred beneath the Skyhorn Lighthouse, the events around [[Leowin Moonflower]] and the underground temple, and the initial destruction of a large portion of [[Thornhold]] brought on by a massive earthquake that seemed to be triggered for a spherical black orb in the possession of the group of [[Drow]] from [[House Xorlarrin]] whom the party had a violent confrontation with below the lighthouse.

As they talked, [[Rushnaa]] appeared to tell Teymir that she believes that it's time for him to try and contact [[Dunamis]] directly. She referred to Dunamis as the "[[Weaver of Threads]]" and told Teymir that nothing happens on accident but is always one of many possibilities woven by Dunamis. Teymir sat quietly in the chilly valley as light snow began to fall and the wind blew across the tall grass and began to somehow communicate with Dunamis through a warmth that would well up inside Teymir as he asked poignant questions. He found out that [[Telamont Tanthul]] is not alive and also found out that he is [[Netherese]]. The two began to make camp and prepare for the next day to determine where their path will take them next.

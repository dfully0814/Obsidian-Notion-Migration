#recap 
# Last we left off...
You all had re-convened in your room in the [[Stone Stallion]] to discuss your next steps before your 2:00 meeting with [[Captain Roland Royston]] of the [[Everwatch Knights]]. You decided to first stop by [[Aiden Zatchet]]'s office to discuss any potential help he might be able to offer to this meeting. He told you that he had put some elements in place in the event that the meeting went sideways but did not give you specifics. When [[Robinson Fellweather]] voiced his skepticism and lack of trust for Zatchet's help, he pulled out a small orange pebble from a bottom drawer in his desk that he handed to Robinson, telling him that he respects his cynicism and that he sees hard earned trust as good business. He also told you that if you were looking to travel up further north, [[Imbry's Cloaks]] would be a good place for you to stop to look for warmer clothing.

Once you all met back in your room, [[John Smith]] began working with [[Elleanna Corvus]] using the disguise kit [[Teymir]] purchased to disguise her as a burned victim from [[Kheldell]]. Meanwhile, Robinson spent some time trying to detect any magical or abnormal properties in the orange stone given to him by Zatchet. As he attempted to peer into the properties of the stone, he immediately detected the stone was not natural as an almost sentient entity seemed to shield his ability to look further into the stone's properties and detect its nature, magical type, etc.

You then proceeded to the [[Amphail Communciations Office]] where you saw an up scale building with renaissance style architecture and detailed vibrant frescoes painted all across the ceiling depicting a battle between what looked like a silver blue dragon and and a group of solid colored dragons with soldiers on both sides painted like a renaissance depiction of a large battle where bodies are painted on top of bodies giving a look of depth.

[[John Smith]] and [[Yang Tieh]] both decided to pay to send messages to [[Waterdeep]] using the office's pneumatic message service. You then met an energetic and slightly neurotic halfling named [[Everard Acton]] who introduced himself as the proprietor of the communications office. As he went to notify [[Captain Roland Royston]] of your arrival, Yang searched through the concierge desk in the lobby and found a decorative revolver with an ivory handle. Realizing he had been seen by onlooking [[Everwatch Knights]], Yang didn't take it. Robison intercepted the Everwatch Knight guards who began to approach and inquire as to what Yang was doing, shouting "Show me your tubes" and was able to slow them down long enough for Yang to step away from the desk but was not able to distract their interest in Yang.

As they began to question Yang, other knights came to escort the group to see Captain Royston. You passed beyond the lobby to a second large room where you saw red, black, and blue robed figures sitting across from patrons exchanging currency with a hazy mirror-like image between them depicting different faces of individuals that the robed figures seemed to be speaking to.

As you passed to the back of the room and up the back stairs to the second floor, Yang felt a gravitational pull in his pack as he felt tingling in his hands and body while the lights in the room flickered slightly. He witnessed this two or three more times before leaving the office near the door in the back of the room.

You then entered Mr. Acton's glass enclosed office which had been commandeered by Captain Royston. You saw two crimson clad knights as well as a black, red, and blue robed figure who you later learned was from the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. You saw that Captain Royston was wearing a gold and black embroidered caplet and sash as opposed to the crimson and black of the other knights there. He was a grayish blue skinned [[Dragonborn]] around 7.5ft tall with a faint blue hue in his eyes.

He began to question you heavily. Primarily focusing on Yang, he began to ask what you knew about the giant creature that attacked [[Kheldell]], the attack on [[Thornhold]], and your knowledge of the [[Valkurians]] who he told you they recently discovered were complicit in the attack on Thornhold and that one of their agents had killed an Everwatcher. He also briefly mentioned the kingdom of [[Aerilon]] was "at war" with the "[[Thayans]]" to the East. He also mentioned that the city of Thornhold had been attacked by "Dark Elves" and was currently "occupied" by them. Sensing that Yang wasn't being fully truthful, Captain Royston instructed the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] individual to cast a Zone of Truth spell on everyone in the room, which Yang failed. He questioned Yang again about the Valkurians, but oddly never directly asked if Yang was one. Yang told Royston that there was a Valkurian cell working out of [[Thornhold]] and [[Waterdeep]], however, confirming his intel that they do in fact exist and are operating in the [[Dessarin Valley]].

You then made your way back out of the communications office into the intersections of [[Amphail]] where you soon came upon a mob of 20 or so nobles, men and women, some in crimson and some in teal waistcoats arguing and shouting slanders and curses at one another. The shouting and arguing escalated quickly until you heard the crack of several gun shots, igniting a panic in the onlooking crowd. At this point, Robinson pushed Ell into a nearby alleyway as you began running among the crowd back to your rooms at the Stone Stallion.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦.

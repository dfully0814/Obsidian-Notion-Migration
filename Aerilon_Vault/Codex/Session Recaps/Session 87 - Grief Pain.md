# Last we left off...
After [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] shared with you regarding his lost brother [[Aldous Cassalanter]] and his desire to find him, [[Yang Tieh]] meanwhile conversed through hand motions and pen and paper with the [[Drow]] woman regarding the beacon. He discovered that there is a male Drow who is trapped in the beacon that the woman desires to free. She indicated that once that is done, the beacon is your's.

[[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] then shared with the party that his father [[Bertio Cassalanter]] is a connoisseur of magical items and artifacts and if you search the villa grounds you made find equipment to aid you in venturing into the citadel.

Your group split up to begin searching the grounds. [[Elleanna Corvus]] ventured outside into a large garden while [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] traveled to the second floor of the guest house where [[Yang Tieh]] found a magical necklace that appears to allow him to dominate the mind of a creature who unknowingly wields it, and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] discovered a secret stone passageway in the back of a wardrobe where he found a [[House Cassalanter]] noble imprisoned and out of his wits walking back and forth into the iron grate of his cell.

Meanwhile, [[Elleanna Corvus]] searched the garden to find six human figures you later learned for all members of [[House Grahlund]] standing in deep holes dug in the ground, also walking back and forth into the walls of the holes. [[Elleanna Corvus]] shouted to [[Teymir]] regarding what she had found, causing the figures in the holes to begin wailing and moaning. Soon, an angry hulking [[House Cassalanter]] male existed from the Coach House followed by a grief-stricken female. Both figures eventually detected [[Gerard Vos]], [[Teymir]], and [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] who were hiding in the Guest House and attacked. The male figure began fixated on [[Gerard Vos]] as he wrapped the tendons of his abnormally long arm around Vos' neck and continued to squeeze and send waves of anger into Vos.

The same occurred between [[Teymir]] and the female, who wielded long sharp hooks for arms and regularly grabbed [[Teymir]] and sent waves of her grief into him.

After bringing both creatures to the point of their deaths, [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] ended up finishing off both of them. You watched him physically slice the air itself and he seemed to pull the spirit or essence from the body of the male figure and inhale it through his mask.

[[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] searched the body of the male who he told [[Gerard Vos]] was his uncle [[Victor Cassalanter]], who he explained was the historian and archivist of the family--collating research about the ancient family, updating family trees, etc. He found a small notebook of research notes on the body that he took with him.

You all conversed back in the garden where you decided you would go back into the Guest House to find [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]].

And that's where we pick up....

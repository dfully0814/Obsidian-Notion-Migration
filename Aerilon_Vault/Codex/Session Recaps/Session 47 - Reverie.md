# Last we left off...
As [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] continued parsing through [[Kwalish Tanthul]]'s journal, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]] continued exploring through the Medical Station of the island. Peering through the glass viewport of a door in the back of the operating room they initially entered, they saw three more deformed creatures shuffling along a hallway with flickering fluorescent lights and medical cabinets spread throughout the hallway. They both entered and Yang and Robinson began searching the cabinets, finding some of the fleshly tendrils they saw coming out of the creature's bodies and also finding a rack containing several large beakers of the black ichor you have seen previously. Yang filled up all of his vials with the ichor before he and Robinson continued down the hall into the back room. In the backroom, they found a warehouse-sized room of 50 or so gurneys with bodies laying on them in various states of transformation to an ashen-gray color, long fingers, and a green fungus growing out of their bodies. From some of the bodies, they saw the fungus growing down to the floor. Yang searched the medical cabinets in the room and found enough utensils to compile a surgical kit, along with a red laser that can be used to apply concentrated heat to a small area.

Meanwhile, Teymir and Ell completed reading Kwalish's journal and attempted to disconnect the journal from the wires connecting it to the smaller floating island. When Teymir successfully disconnected the wires, a large explosion occurred, sending the floating island plummeting down into the pit of Draconic bodies below, creating a high plume of black smoke in the air. Teymir, Ell, and John then started making their way south back to the dock when suddenly [[John Smith]] and Teymir were overcome with intense desires to travel to the west of the island--John to find his greatest score and Teymir to finally discover something of his past.

Everyone eventually made their way to an open hatch to the west of the island that lead to an underwater tunnel where it seemed a plotting and intelligent creature has been gradually luring you--John soon seeing a room full of gold and Teymir seeing what he believed to be his father's workshop. As Ell entered, she saw a 60ft hallway with bodies floating up to the ceiling and a pile of used energy cells stacked along both walls. Beyond the hallway, she saw a room 300ft in diameter with a 150ft diameter glowing orange sphere in the middle and a pile of about 200 used energy cells off to the side near the back wall.

Ell began desperately attempting to convince Teymir not to continue into the larger room, but all of her attempts proved unsuccessful as Teymir appeared convinced this room contained what he had been searching for for over 5 years now. Seeing she wasn't getting anywhere with Teymir, she hypnotized him, grabbed his armor, removed his energy cell, and teleported out of the tunnel to the surface where the two eventually met with Yang and Robinson. Teymir, still carrying the overwhelming conviction his past lied at the bottom of the ladder to the west, inserted another energy cell into his armor and sped back to the hatch.

Meanwhile, as he was basking in the mountains of gold and platinum he had found, John came face to face with an otherworldly creature that wrapped its long black tentacle around his leg and began pulling him ever closer as he became enthralled and comforted by it. The race was on as the rest of the party sped back to the hatch to save John and stop Teymir from wandering into the same fate. You began fighting the creature, seeing that John had managed to successfully break free of the creature's grasp using his armor and you all provided covering attacks for him as he fled from the large circular room, bright flashing bolts of orange lightning firing over his head and all around the room as the creature seemed to be drawing power from the sphere in the middle.

Everyone has made their way into the tunnel once again except Robinson, who is on the other side of the creature as it stares down the tunnel at Ell and John who have grappled Teymir to the ground and are continuing to try and break him from his stupor.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

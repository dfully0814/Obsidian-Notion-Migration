# Last we left off...
After stashing your magic items you all made your way into a large [[Everwatch Knights]] encampment at the base of a [[House Xorlarrin]] citadel situated in the coastal mountains where [[Thornhold]] was once located. You were then escorted by a pair of knights to the end of the camp to [[Lady Liane Antiet]], [[Archmage of Domestic Protections]] in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. When you entered her tent, you met a middle-aged whimsical woman with ornately braided gray hair wearing navy blue, gold, and silver robes.

In spite of the anti-magic field around the camp, she seemed to still be able to perform magic as you saw her conjure chairs for you to sit in out of thin air, create a flask of French liqueur that significantly elevated [[Azure Flint]]'s spirits, and was seemingly able to read your minds--to what degree you're not sure. Yang began to speak with her, telling her that you've come to help because [[Thornhold]] was his home and he wants to stop whatever is happening to it. She responded by telling [[Yang Tieh]] that Thornhold was also once her home. When he asked if stopping whatever is up in the citadel would end what's happening with Thornhold she said that she couldn't say for sure. However, she did begin to share with your party her vested interest in your success. Yang told her that he was paying the rest of you to help him in this endeavor, saying that the payment is in the citadel. Reading into her expressions, Yang was able to discern she likely knew you were after the beacon ([[Sirin Beacons]]) in the citadel. She continued by asking your party to not allow [[Captain Roland Royston]] assigned escort to retrieve the beacon and bring it back to the [[Everwatch Knights]]. [[Teymir]] also noticed she became incensed at one point when Yang referred to the knights as “her knights,” when she replied, “they are not my knights.” She concluded by giving you her blessing to conduct an infiltration of the citadel and provided you with a set of gauntlets with claws and a gem of seeing, telling you that they should aid you in your endeavor.

Once the rest of the party exited [[Lady Liane Antiet]]s tent, Teymir stayed behind and mentioned seeing the [[The Palpable Cohesion of Formless Corporeality]] on her desk, which she didn't respond to. [[Lady Liane Antiet]] then shared with Teymir that she knew him and that the man who trained him, [[Master Aegith Rane]] was currently at the camp and he would be very happy to see Teymir. She also referred to [[Gerard Vos]] by the name of "[[Bren]]'' and said that she knows them both and that she considers them both family. When Teymir asked her what he was being trained for, she replied, "Greatness."

After you exited [[Lady Liane Antiet]]'s tent, you had [[Captain Roland Royston]] direct you to the tent where you could find your companion. He directed you to a tent which bore the [[House Cassalanter]] family crest prominently on one side of it. As you entered, you met a dagger and grenade clad figure wearing a white and gold porcelain mask who you soon learned you once knew as [[Aiden Zatchet]] but you now know to be [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]. He told [[Yang Tieh]] that he had been hunting [[Alas Grahlund]] for quite some time but infiltrating his estate had proved more difficult than he anticipated. He told you that though your brutal interrogation of him was difficult, it had at least proved to be worth it in the end. He told you not to worry, that [[Robinson Fellweather]] was safe--assuring you that the Cassalanters don't kill their own blood. He told you that Zatchet was a particular persona he took on in order to infiltrate [[House Grahlund]]'s estate and told you that he "can be anything."

After a few members of the party threw a few insults at him, seeming to not care and ignore the seething hostility in the room, he asked you to have some wine and a meal with him before venturing into the citadel. As he brought a hand full of wine glasses over to your party, he also brought five small glass vials. He proceeded to ask each of you to fill a single vial with your blood so that "you could be located in case you opt to do anything you probably shouldn't." When you questioned this ask further, he told you that it was [[Captain Roland Royston]]'s orders and that this is a normal ask of everyone serving with the knights.

Your party quickly refused his request, some of you telling him to bring Royston and [[Teymir]] soon choosing to get up and walk out of the tent. At this point, you watched as a pulled a grenade from his shoulder straps, detonated it, and filled the tent with blinding fog and proceeded to jump behind Ell, grab her, and place a dagger to her throat. Having decided to follow Teymir out of the tent, [[Azure Flint]] had just exited the tent when this occurred at which point he turned around and drew his rifle and a stand off ensued.

[[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] asked [[Gerard Vos]] and Yang once again to fill the vial with their blood. Yang was the first to do so while also mixing some of the black ichor in with his blood in the vial. Symund began cutting into [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s neck and drew blood from her into a vial. He then asked Vos once more to place his blood in the vial, and Vos responded again by asking him to consult Royston. Seeing that Teymir had left the tent, Azure had a gun trained on him from behind, and Vos was obstinate, Lord Symund said in an almost whimsical tone, "I guess we should've had more wine first." He then suddenly pressed his dagger into Ell's neck, causing her neck to spew blood as she fell unconscious and he casually walked out of the tent after taking two direct laser blasts from Vos and Azure's guns, which seemed to cause him pain but he strangely managed to shake off after a few moments.

Having heard and seen the blast from his rifle into an [[Everwatchers]] tent, several [[Everwatch Knights]] converged on Azure's location outside in the camp and attempted to tackle him to the ground, which he managed to successfully subvert resulting in a tense melee between Azure and four Everwatch Knights, which ended when the knights chased Azure back into the tent, slashing him with swords, and then halting their advance as Vos raised what appeared to be a live grenade into the air, telling the knights once again to go get their boss.

And that's where we pick up. [[Teymir]] has been headed back to the tent of [[Lady Liane Antiet]], Ell lies unconscious but stabilized by Yang as he sits beside her continuing to drink wine and eat nuts, Vos holds what the knights believe to be a live grenade in his hand, and Azure begins to get up off the ground after he's slipped out of the hold of one of the knights just moments before.

#recap 
# Last we left off...
The party began camping near the crest of a large hill in the [[Dessarin Valley]] overlooking the destruction of the logging settlement of [[Kheldell]]. As [[Teymir]] began an attempt to connect the various clues the party has discovered over the past two weeks, he began to hear the distant sound of a harmonica making its way through the valley and up and over the crest of the hill.

As he made his way to investigate the sound, he discovered that it was coming from the small encampment of [[Robinson Fellweather]], a good friend of [[Azure Flint]]'s whom he promised to send in his place when he left the camp in the [[Kryptgarden Forest]]. Teymir recognized him, having met with him and Azure in [[Waterdeep]] on occasion. Robinson mentioned to Teymir that it seems Azure it "going down a path..." and informed Teymir that he had been tracking the party for a week or so, having made his way to [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]'s camp where he found it abandoned and a note indicating that the presence of the [[Everwatchers]] was growing too heavy.

No other information was given. As the two were conversing in the camp, [[John Smith]] began his watch at the hill camp. One hour into his watch, John saw what appeared to be two large mechanical creatures flying from the north, periodically expelling what looked like large fireballs from their backs into the air as they flew. They each had a large glowing red eye, a beaked mouth, wingspan about 60ft across, and 30ft long, the exterior of their bodies overlaid in silver plating with gold trim. They each had a humanoid figure riding on the back.

They quickly flew overhead of both camps, coming to rest above the[[ Westwood Forest]] and proceeded to fire large 300-500ft wide spheres of lightning into the forest. After a period of a few minutes, they flew back and landed outside [[Kheldell]]. You also watched as a group of 20 soldiers approached Kheldell from the east and stayed there the rest of the night. Once Teymir introduced Robinson to the rest of the party, you made your way into the crags of the [[Sword Mountains]] to find a protected area to camp for the rest of the evening. After a few hours of search, you found a safe place to camp that looked down upon the [[Dessarin Valley]] and the smoking Kheldell.

The next day, [[John Smith]] noticed a few riders leaving the [[Kheldell]] headed back east from which the group of 20 came. He noticed the teal blue skirts of the [[Everwatch Knights]] draped around the horses as they rode. He also watched as the remaining soldiers helped the living citizens of the settlement begin to bury the hundred or so dead bodies lying in the settlement. After the party deliberated, you decided to continue through the crags of the Sword Mountains heading toward the Westwood Forest to investigate the target of the raid upon the forest that you witnessed the previous evening. After a full days travel, you found your way down to the foothills of the mountain and into the forest, riding the backs of [[Kaya]] and Robinson's black boar.

As you began traversing the forest, you observed large 300ft-500ft wide sections of the forest that looked like they had been bombed; the area mostly ash and ember. When you stopped at the first of these areas to investigate, you found 15 or so small orange pebbles buried among the ash that appeared to have been disbursed throughout the ash. You also discovered what looked like large footprints in the ground that initially looked like craters until you were able to establish a stride and pattern as they seemed to continue further into the forest.

They were about 10ft long and 4ft wide. Teymir sent [[Rushnaa]] further ahead to investigate. After about 45 minutes, she returned telling him that she saw 3 different log cutter camps that had been destroyed with men, women, and children indiscriminately lying about the camps. It appeared to her that the large footsteps had entered the camps, veering from its direct path through the forest as it ran. She also mentioned that she followed the footprints to the end, near the middle of the forest where she saw a "large creature" and then immediately turned around and left. And that's where we pick up. You are in the Westwood Forest as the sun is setting and darkness is coming upon you and Teymir has just received the message from Rushnaa.

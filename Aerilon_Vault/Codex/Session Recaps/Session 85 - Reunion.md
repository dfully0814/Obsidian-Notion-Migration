#recap 
# Last we left off...
As the dust settled from your harrowing encounter with the Drow priestess, you all made your way into a small niche [[Teymir]] created in the wall of the cavern, soon to be followed by [[Yang Tieh]] and a [[Drow]] female wearing a white-haired wig underneath which she appeared to be hiding a small red stone that she used to track down and brutally kill an [[Everwatch Knights]] solider who also appeared to be a member of [[House Cassalanter]]. 

As you prepared to sleep and rest your weary bodies, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] began discussing meeting [[Dak Grella]] and being in [[Elall]] and the 5 years that passed while Teymir was there. He shared with [[Elleanna Corvus]] how he missed her while he was there and how he had the opportunity to process a lot of the emotions from her betrayal over that time. Ell appeared to him to be sorry, but more-so sorry that she was caught and is in this position in the first place.

[[Teymir]] shared with Ell that he doesn't want her to be threatened by [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s presence with the group and explained how much Fennis mattered to him. He told Ell that he's going to continue to follow his instincts and right now his instincts tell him to trust her even though he knows that will leave him vulnerable to her.

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] took her watch, she began to hear the sound to bodies being thrown around the chamber and up against the stone walls. She peaked out of the stone door of the secret chamber to see the tall and looming form of [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], Matron Mother of [[House Xorlarrin]] bent over the body of the dead Drow priestess. As Ell quickly ducked back inside after being warned by [[Teymir]] to be quiet and still, you all heard a scream of agony that crescendoed into a bestial roar, causing many areas of the cavern chamber to collapse as you all then heard heavy footfalls disappear into the distance along with a bestial growl.

You then decided to look for Fennis' gear, which you were unsuccessful in doing. You then decided to make your way back in the direction you came since the forward direction appeared to be mostly collpased in except for one path. You traveled back to the first chamber you entered after meeting with [[Abrak Vraelo]] and looped around and up a narrow tunnel when [[Yang Tieh]] began to hear the sound of humming in the distance and saw the strobing of something sparking around the corner.

He stealthily peered around the corner to see a [[Drow]] figure with well-groomed white hair sitting over an armor-clad body with two large devices in each of its hands that looked like nail guns. Around the room Yang saw a number of large tanks filled with clear liquid with naked humanoid bodies floating in them with large cables running from the tops of the tanks into a cylindrical generator-like device.

[[Yang Tieh]] stealthily crept up behind the figure, drinking down the wine poured in the figure's glass on a table next to him, and proceeded to hold a dagger up to the figure's throat.

As he got half way down the hallway, [[Teymir]] began sensing a burning smell when he suddenly found himself out of his body in a memory where his face was initially buried in a cloth material of some kind, hearing the voice he immediately recognized of his mentor and father-figure [[Master Aegith Rane]] from the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] sharing comforting words with him, saying

> "O, Teymir. I'm so proud of you. It's doing the hardest things that make us the strongest. The bravest among men are the ones willing to do what no one else will. And you are brave. Your heart is a fire. We are who we are because it is our responsibility to stick our hands down in the very filth of the world if necessary to expunge it so that the common man need not even have the knowledge that there ever was a danger. We sacrifice for the peace of everyone else. Find strength in your heart, my boy. The children of Aerilon will sleep soundly in their beds tonight and it's all thanks to you."

He looked around to see the walls of a home burning with a radiant glow and a pair of abnormally-sized bodies lying in a bed also burning with radiance, their bodies almost ash.

And that's where we pick up...

Having survived your encounter with the large centipede, [[Robinson Fellweather]], [[Yang Tieh]], and [[John Smith]] found themselves in a large cavern that seemed to extend endlessly in both directions. Ripping his eye out, Robinson sent it down in one direction, eventually entering a large cavernous space with large stalactites and stalagmites where he saw about 10 bedrolls spread out on the ground, with splattered trails of coagulated blood splattered throughout that he determined continued to lead in the direction of the large tunnel continuing on past the open space. Deciding not to continue on, he met back with Yang and John as you all made your way back up to the previous cavern where you begin, entering a tense confrontation with a Hobgoblin arcanist named [[Klovag]] and his troupe of wolves and other armed Hobgoblins with him.

After presenting Klovag with one of the small orange stones in her possession, [[Elleanna Corvus]] managed to deescalate an otherwise inevitably violent confrontation between you and Klovag's party. Ell watched as his demeanor rapidly changed from terse and gruff to a child-like fascination as though he was working to hide this aspect of himself but had his guard unknowingly brought down by the stone. Klovag went on to share that the stone seemed to be a small piece of a [[Mythallar]], which he told you were devices developed by the archmages of [[Netheril Empire]] that had the ability to harness raw arcane energy in a concentrated form and that the [[Netherese]] used these devices to power entire cities known as enclaves that could fly thousands of feet in the air. He also told you that anytime an enclave was powered by a Mythallar, the device would have Netherese inscriptions bearing the mark of the enclave engraved in the material used to create the device. He could make out a Netherese inscription but couldn't fully tell which enclave it represented. He also mentioned that to a respectable arcanist, a Mythallar is a symbol of greed, vanity, and destruction as he sees the empire of Netheril itself exhibiting all of these traits culminating in [[Karsus' Folly]].

You eventually decided to travel with Klovag to meet an individual he referred to as [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] in the underground city of [[Baraskur]]. On the journey, [[Teymir]] shared the many connections he has begun to make regarding the malady you have encountered, the information you learned about [[Telamont Tanthul]] and his connection to it and the overall connection with recent events to what you encountered in the underground temple.

Teymir was also approached by [[Rushnaa]] who shared with him more information regarding who she is. She told him that she was a "[[Sirin]]" and that before the [[Calamity]] the Sirin were fierce warriors and guardians of "things that should not be known" and servants of "[[Dunamis]]". She shared that during the Calamity, the Sirin were defeated by the [[Betrayer Gods]], bringing the Sirin to a fraction of their former power before being locked away behind the [[Divine Gate]] with the rest of the gods at the end of the Calamity. She shared that she still serves Dunamis and acts as a guide and protector of hidden knowledge and possibility and that Teymir must possess something hidden in need of protection and that was the purpose for which she was summoned to his side to guide him to its discovery. She ended by sharing she hoped the discovery of it would not result in their being on opposing sides.

You arrived in Baraskur, seeing a large group of red-skinned and well-armed Hobgoblin individuals as well as groups of male and female [[Tiefling]]s operating in servitude to them. You also saw one Hobgoblin individual fly from one side of an upper tiered area of the city to another. As you began following Klovag into what appeared to be the city square, Teymir met his gaze with a Hobgoblin named Insk about 30ft away, who immediately unsheathed two swords and has begun running in Teymir's direction, as he has heard Klovag say, "I'm sorry but you will have to kill him."

As that's where we pick upâ€¦

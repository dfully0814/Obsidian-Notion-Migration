#recap 
# Last we left off...
You had just entered a makeshift prison area in the caverns under the [[House Xorlarrin Citadel]] when a malnourished and abnormally tall and slender cloaked figure grabbed [[Teymir]] by the arm, causing both individuals to become catatonic and fall to the ground seemingly unconscious. 

Simultaneously, the rest of the party began hearing shouts from the tunnel ahead of you as it seemed more [[House Xorlarrin]] groups were heading to your location. As you all made preparations, [[Elleanna Corvus]] levitated [[Teymir]] to the ceiling to safety while [[Yang Tieh]] began scaling the wall to attack from the ceiling. 

Suddenly, another human faced arachnid creature burst through the left side of the prison walls and attacked and was soon destroyed by several shots from [[Gerard Vos]] and an attack from the ceiling by [[Yang Tieh]] as he struck the killing blow with his spear, which resulted in a black liquid spray from the creatures body in all directions. 

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]] opened his eyes to see a familiar scene around him that he soon discovered was a peaceful memory of his of the shores near [[Waterdeep]] as the sun was setting. He found a brown wide-brimmed hat near a lit fire, which he began to investigate. As he passed his hand over the top of the hat, he had a another memory flash of being in the [[Dock Ward]] near his home and seeing an individual sitting on the edge of one of the long piers fishing. 

The individual was wearing the same hat he found near the fire and a long brown trench coat and appeared to have pale yellow skin. 

Back on the shores, [[Teymir]] began to feel his emotions and longing for home surge. As his emotions began to surge in the beauty of the sunset on the horizon, the sky above started to transition from purple to dark red to black. Teymir also began to notice that his cure t awareness of where he was became increasingly harder to grasp. 

Terrified, he ran to a nearby tree line where he encountered a threatening shadow form which lunged at him and began to consume one of his most treasured recent memories of being a child in a carpentry shop next to a abnormally large and comforting man. The details of that memory began to change and become increasingly difficult to remember correctly. 

He was soon saved by the successive blasts of strange high tech guns from an individual who introduced himself as [[Dak Grella]]. He recognized the individual from his memory flash sitting on the edge of the pier fishing. 

[[Dak Grella]] shared with Teymir that he was formally one of the [[Anarchs]] of his people. These individuals possessed unique and powerful psychic abilities to form protective realities from memories that need to be carefully chosen according to their potency. He shared that he and Teymir were in his home which he called [[Elall]].

He shared that something had happened to [[Elall]] long ago and it had become an oppressive place for his people, a place that seemed to feed on the minds of his people, particularly their memories and psychic abilities. Realizing their people might be consumed entirely, they appointed [[Anarchs]] to form places like this memory of Teymirs to serve and protective shields upon which [[Elall]] would feed until it was necessary to reform a new reality when the current one had been consumed to dangerous levels. 

You learned that in [[Elall]] there seems to be no dimension of time. He didn't mention details regarding the origin of his people, but he said that a millenia or so ago some of his people encountered explorers from [[Toril]] traveling in large vessels. It was from these people that his people learned the concept of family and death and may were intrigued by it. They began traveling in small numbers to [[Toril]] in order to have children, live normal lives, and die. This sparked a civil war between who he referred to as the [[Githzerai]] and [[Githyanki]]--the [[Githzerai]] being those of his people wanting to come to [[Toril]]. 

You also learned that his son [[Zera]] had formed a close bond with [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] and would sometimes come to [[Toril]] with him. The last journey that they left, they never returned so he had come to [[Toril]] for the first time in search of his son, abandoning his responsibilities as one of the [[Anarchs]], meaning that many of his people have likely perished because of him and he dare not go back now. [[Teymir]] shared with him having seen [[Zera]] aboard the [[Paramount]]. 

He told [[Teymir]] that he wouldn't allow Teymir to leave until he was ready to face what he perceived as [[Elall]]'s oncoming threat to [[Toril]] against which no one on Toril is prepared. He shared he has grown fond of the people of Toril and does not want to see [[Elall]] consume them while they wait defenseless. 

Over the next significant period of time, Teymir began to train with Dak and learn how to mentally defend himself against [[Elall]]. As the years went by, Teymir began to dig up new memories from his past. One of those memories where he was a child playing with Drow children in a vibrantly colored jungle area where the children asked, "Where is [[Rushnaa]]?" Another memory Teymir saw a gray cloaked figure in manacles emitting a pale blue glow aboard a war ship of the [[Everwatch Knights]] being lead into the [[Dock Ward]] of [[Waterdeep]]. The figure was escorted by a group of knights toward the [[Temple of Helm]] and locked eyes with a bald and gray-skinned figure talking to an old merchant with a number of strange artifacts on a cart. As he walked deeper into the [[Dock Ward]], he heard the figure's voice say "Do you wanna be free?" and the memory promptly ended.

And that's where we pick up...

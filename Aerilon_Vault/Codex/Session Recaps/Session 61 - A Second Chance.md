#recap 
# Last we left off...
You continued your battle against a dark warrior whose essence seemed to be mostly darkness and shadow and 3 tentacled beasts. The figure levitated in the air as you watched ethereal black wings extend from its back and begin to reach around the entirety of the area where the party was grouped, obscuring the entire area in deep darkness, causing [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Azure Flint]] to have to step safely out but not be able to see what was occurring inside. Meanwhile, Yang was surrounded by the beasts and the warrior made its way over to [[Yang Tieh]], swinging is glowing green flail with increasing speed, connecting against Yang's body with several concussive blasts of necrotic energy knocking Yang unconscious more than once and banishing him into a dark unknown area made of obsidian rock.

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to shout from up in the air attempting to coordinate a plan of action with the party, she noticed the dark figure strangely hesitate at the sound of her voice for increasingly long amounts of time. She decided to levitate to the ground and approach the figure while it was on horseback, thinking now it might be her father [[Tanavast Adamantus]] after seeing his style of fighting, mannerisms, armor, and body language. As she approached him, the environment around the two of them began to flicker back and forth into the dark reality she has previously seen and then back to her normal reality. This happened a couple of times until the two were seemingly transported to the dark reality and didn't seem to come back.

Ell then heard her father's voice clearly in her head as she watched the body of the figure begin to contort and twist in very unnatural ways. The voice told Ell to quickly leave the valley where you currently found yourselves and also to tell [[Galladon]] that a crossing had opened.

As Ell turned to run, an immense wave of fear from the dark walls around them began to overtake her as she heard a loud crack in the air and found herself lying once again in the valley with everyone else, the dark figure having disappeared along with the beasts.

You all quickly mounted your horses and rode west away from the Long Road valley in the direction of [[Kryptgarden Forest]] and the [[Sword Mountains]]. As you rode, Ell noticed the same large tracks of the creature who seemed to be the source of the devastation from which you had just come. Azure recognized the tracks as that of a legendary [[Chimera]], spoken of in the myths and legends of [[Aerilon]], particularly in the context of stories around the time of the [[Calamity]] when the [[Betrayer Gods]] twisted and distorted natural animals of the world into their own war machines to use against the [[Prime Deities]]. Ell noticed that tracks suddenly ended as they were headed in the direction of the Sword Mountains. You continued forward and found a small external enclosure in the base of the mountains where you could make camp for the evening. [[Yang Tieh]], [[Azure Flint]], and [[Gerard Vos]] quickly fell asleep.

[[Elleanna Corvus]] walked from the camp to communicate with [[Galladon]], receiving a new directive from him which she later shared with [[Teymir]] regarding the recovery of a device in the shape of a dodecahedron which Galladon said would be really important and also mentioned Teymir might be the key to everything, not explaining exactly what he meant.

Teymir and Ell continued discussing and Ell eventually began discussing her vision of her past that she had while interacting with the dark figure out in the valley. She described that it was one of her most treasured memories of her father where she was playing hide and seek with him. He eventually looked under the bed to find her but couldn't see her because she was invisible. It was a bittersweet memory for her because it was both when she felt closest to her father but also when her unnatural abilities first surfaced. She described that this memory was different this time, though. Her father seemed to be immediately be able to see her as if she had no abilities to use. At that, [[Rushnaa]] appeared and began to question Ell with great interest.

She asked Ell if Ell would do everything the same way if she had the chance to do it all over again. She also shared that she believes [[Dunamis]] has also reached out to Ell in revealing this memory to her, a sign that all hope is not lost. Rushnaa went on to share that she too is not fully aware of the events of her past leading to where she is now. She also shared that she also didn't possess a fully knowledge of the nature and purpose of Dunamis. She told Ell and Teymir that after the devastating events of the [[Calamity]], she awoke a much lesser being than she remembered with memories of what she once was only shadows and fragments. She said that she's mean searching for endless years into who she was and what her purpose is, as well as trying to uncover more regarding the nature of Dunamis. She mentioned that she's never come across anyone who seems to have a connection to Dunamis as Ell and Teymir seem to have and that is clarifying for her why she may have been sent to Teymir to begin with.

Teymir then began to commune with Dunamis once again. He saw an endless depth of darkness before him with small motes of light that seemed to bounce off of one another and some combine to form brighter motes of light. He found out that it seems Tanavast is still somehow alive and is able to be helped, which he shared with Ell later.

The two stood inside the base of the mountainside as the campfire provided subtle amounts of warmth on this frigid evening.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

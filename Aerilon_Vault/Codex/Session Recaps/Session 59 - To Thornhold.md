#recap 
# Last we left off...
You began a new morning in the wealthy, dangerous, and morally ambiguous city of [[Yartar]] north of the [[Dessarin Valley]]. You began the morning together in the upscale pub known as the [[The Winter Winds]]. You continued hearing various announcements at half hour intervals regarding various attacks across Aerilon by the Thayans as they began crossing the [[Anauroch Desert]], venturing deeper into the empire.

You began the morning having breakfast together (minus [[Gerard Vos]]), which was served to you by a waitress who seemed to act more familiar toward you than seemed normal. Once she served each of you your orders, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] each felt one of her hands gently touch them on their backs. At this point, the pub around them began to shimmer, dissolve, and shift into a very similar atmosphere except different--different patrons, a different bartender, a different time of day. They watched as the only unchanged individual in the room, the waitress, walked around the table and sat across from them. The waitress' visage slowly dissolved into that of a dark-skinned, white-haired, cerulean blue-eyed [[Galladon]] wearing black jagged armor, spiked pauldrons, and long black spikes coming out of his gauntlets extending several inches beyond his knuckles.

With a shocking fearful reverence, Ell knocked Teymir to the ground thinking Galladon had come to kill him and then knelt before him with head bowed. Galladon somewhat sympathetically asked Ell to sit down at the table and began to make small talk by inquiring from Teymir what he knew about [[Dunamancy]]. Teymir responded that he didn't know much. When Ell inquired about his purpose for appearing to them now, Galladon referred her over to a hooded individual sitting alone at a nearby table wearing fine robes with the symbol of the [[Scourgers]] prominently sown onto the back of the robe. She walked over to the individual seeing that his face has obscured by an almost abyssal-like darkness and was only able to see ashen-colored hands coming from fine clothing and golden gauntlets.

While sitting with Teymir alone, Galladon began to ask him why he kept so many around him who didn't appreciate him and seemingly refused to recognize his contributions and skills.

As Ell began to speak to the robed individual at the table she immediately recognized Teymir's voice, although he did not recognize her. She began to press him for information to see the nature of this interaction and what he knew and didn't know. He quickly became annoyed with her repeated questions and demanded that she leave. When she pressed once more he suddenly shattered his mug he was holding, sending the various shards toward her face before suspending them mid-flight as Ell watched each shard begin to give off a subtle rippling vibration.

Before she had the opportunity to leave the table, Teymir watched as Galladon said, "Do you hear that? Almost, and now," and proceeded to make a motion with his hand at which point Ell watched the entire room fold in on itself, revealing a new scene behind it, a scene of the inside of a very familiar church to Ell from her hometown of [[Phandalin]], a [[Church of Bahamut]], seated next to her mother in a pew. She watched as several priests of [[Bahamut]], clad in blue and silver robes, walked down the middle aisle of the church carrying various censers of smoking incense. When they arrived at the front, the back door swung open and voices started haphazardly shouting, "Get down!," as various robed individuals wearing the same white cowls overlaying darker finer clothing and black obscured faces as Ell saw in the pub, began targeting specific noble individuals in the cathedral, grabbing them around the face and sending waves of radiant light out of their eyeballs, instantly killing them where they sat. One of the robed figures began to rush to the front of the church where he saw Ell standing, having decided to not follow her mother out of the church this time but instead stand in the middle aisle and face the attackers. The robed individual rushed up to Ell, looked behind and killed one of the priests who was suddenly revealed to have transformed into a red-robed individual with a bald ceremonially tattooed head resembling that of the Thayans. The figure pulled back the hood of his robe, revealing himself to be Teymir and shouting at Ell to get out of the church as he proceeded to turn and face now empty pews. Ell watched him begin to wave his hands as the whole church seemed to begin to shimmer, a large dark sphere began to grow at the center and bend and discolor all the beams of light coming through the stained glass. At this point the scene folded in on itself and Ell found herself back in the pub sitting with Galladon and Teymir.

Shocked and awestruck, Ell attempted to contain herself and asked Galladon what his directive was. He told her that he was interested in destroying the [[House Xorlarrin]] dark elves who have begun to surface for unknown reasons to the south. He didn't give reason for wanting to do so. Galladon told Ell that he would be in touch and the scene around them was once again folded in on itself revealing once again the same pub except Teymir and Ell were now once again seated with the party as Yang concluded telling Ell how he was once again reacquainted with [[Leowin Moonflower]].

Teymir and Ell took a short ride on their horses out of town to discuss what they had seen and Ell shared with Teymir what she had seen in the church.

Meanwhile, [[Azure Flint]] discussed with Yang about the two blood vials he found after pick-pocketing one of the hired hands of the [[The Winter Winds]]. The two decided that it might be profitable to contact [[Robinson Fellweather]] to discuss what the vials might mean.

Yang then set out to acquire supplies for your coming journey where he met a good friend of Vos' who seemed to be a doctor who saw patients "off the books" and seemed to have all manner of strange and mysterious potions and oddities in the storage room of his clinic. He gave Yang several potions, which Vos offered to fully cover, which Yang offered to also contribute to.

Vos and Yang eventually made his way into the pub to meet the group, telling them that there seems to be no sign of [[Mary Emsworth]] around Yartar and the entire group eventually convened back at the pub to discuss traveling to [[Thornhold]] next and how you would go about doing so. You decided to stay off the main roads and travel back west, keeping north of the [[Sword Mountains]] through the hills south of the [[Triboar Trail]] and out to the coast before making your way down to Thornhold.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

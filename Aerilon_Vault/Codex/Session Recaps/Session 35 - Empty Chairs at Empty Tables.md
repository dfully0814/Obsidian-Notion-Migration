# Last we left off...
Panic erupted in the streets as gunshots rang out from the midst of a mob of 20 young [[House Cassalanter]] and [[House Grahlund]] individuals cursing and coming to blows in the middle of a large intersection of [[Amphail]]. You found different positions near [[Evelyn's General Store]] where you were able to look and in an attempt to learn more about what was transpiring. Pressing his body up against the southwestern side of Everlyn's General Store, [[Yang Tieh]] was one of the first to see the bloodletting begin in the street as an old Cassalanter around 30 years of age raised a decorative revolver toward him.

He fired a shot at Yang, missing Yang while almost simultaneously a soldier of the [[Everwatch Knights]] walked up behind the Cassalanter man, extended his arm revealing a deadly spiked gauntlet which he then almost surgically stabbed into the back upper spine and occipital area of the brain simultaneously, rendering the man dead before he fell to the ground.

[[Robinson Fellweather]] vaulted onto the roof of a nearby pottery store to survey the situation when he heard the sound of something landing on a roof nearby him to the sound and jumping again. Realizing he didn't see [[Elleanna Corvus]] anywhere near him, he found her in a nearby alleyway with a drunken nobleman in a headlock. He helped Ell finish overtaking the man and then went back to the roof where he wasn't able to see any other indication of the sound on the rooftop he had previously heard.

Ell then assumed the guise of the drunken man and proceeded to make her way to the eastern main thoroughfare to a wealthier residential section of [[Amphail]] where she found a noble husband and wife and proceeded to engage them, which didn't go as well as she hoped. The couple assumed he man had come from the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]], was mostly condescending toward him, and didn't seem interested in talking to him. She then assumed the form of an elderly noble man she saw, she later learn was named "Mr. Arryn" that this same noble couple seemed to know. They didn't seem surprised at the fighting that had ensued between the two families, mentioning that it must be "due to all this election business."

As the violence was claiming life after life, [[Yang Tieh]] walked near the intersection and grabbed the [[House Cassalanter]] man's revolver without anyone noticing and later proceeded to inspect the bodies along with [[Teymir]] after the knights began hauling away the remaining nine [[House Grahlund]] and Cassalantar individuals south toward the communications office. Yang noticed the methodical and textbook way the knights handled the situation, their lack of any confusion or panic, their ability to know who to subdue first, and a mysterious ability to instill fear, causing some of the nobles to surrender their weapons in the throes of anger seemingly by just approaching them.

Yang noticed that all the individuals were less than 20 years old except the one that had raised the gun to him. He noticed that all the gunshots were inaccurately aimed at nonvital organs for the most part but there were just a lot of gunshots on each body. While investigating one of the Grahlund bodies, [[Teymir]] found a small pin of a silver dragon on a royal blue background.

[[Robinson Fellweather]] found a note on one of the [[House Cassalanter]] bodies listing three female names.

Yang then decided to follow some robed figures wearing the same silver and royal blue colors as the pin Teymir found as they came to collect the bodies lying in the street. He followed them to a much older looking stone church building displaying the same silver and royal blue dragon flags on either side of the main door. While watching the robed figures wheel the bodies around to the back of the church to a graveyard, [[Aiden Zatchet]], who had been following Yang, approached him and handed him a note and walked away. When looking for Zatchet later, you learned he had left to [[Rassalantar]] for business.

You eventually made your way back to [[Evelyn's General Store]], acquired all your belongings via a secret tunnel underground and prepared to leave.

[[Mary Emsworth]] then told Ell that she would have to kill her in order to help her. Reluctantly agreeing, [[Tick-Clack]] fired a green beam into Ell's head, killing her. The putrid fungus, sores, and bubbling skin seemed to crawl off her body leaving behind a flaky ashen body like a husk and crawled toward Mary. Mary allowed it to crawl onto her body and begin to overtake her when she began to set fire and elementally transform and seemingly magically incinerate the entity. She then walked over to Ell, letting out red-orange essence from her mouth into Ell's nose and eyes and mouth, causing her to seemingly "bloom" in front of the rest of you as you watched the ashen skin become pink and color come back into her face.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

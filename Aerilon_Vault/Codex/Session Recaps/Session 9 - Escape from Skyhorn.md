#recap 

# Last we left off...
As a group, you began your escape from the underbelly of the [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]] with a mysterious Elven ([[Elf]]) girl by your side. As the majority of [[Drow]] guards continued falling one by one in the midst of the lethal storm seemingly birthed or conjured from within the girl, the powerful Drow woman and 4 powerful Drow robed figures gave chase to your party, firing black ichorous webs to slow your progress as you hurdled and bounded over and around collapsing rubble from the cave and the ground itself becoming naturally undone. As the majority of the robed figures darted around the party giving chase to Yang and the girl, who had escaped the cavern ahead of everyone else, the Drow woman fired a deadly and crackling bolt of purple energy at [[Teymir]] which he deflected into one of the robed figures, effectively dissolving the figure in mid-air.

Much like what occurred in the deepest area of the cave, **Teymir**'s besting the Drow female incensed her, temporarily distracting her from pursuing the Elven girl and setting her on a course of revenge toward **Teymir**, seemingly to prove her power over him more than simply kill him. She successfully accomplished this by filling him with rage toward other members in the party, which he was saved from through [[John Smith]]'s help and eventually causing him to drop unconscious, having to be floated to the teleportation disc to escape by **[[Azure Flint]]** just as **Azure** swam out of a large gap in the cavern that was now underwater into the deeps of the ocean.

Meanwhile, **[[Yang Tieh]]** successfully made it to the top of the island with the girl, the remaining 3 robed Drow figures in tow. Thinking to protect the girl first and putting himself at risk, **Yang** pushed the girl off of the island cliffside into the water below, subsequently free falling himself and taking a final lightning bolt from one of the robed figures, rendering him unconscious as he plunged into the sea below. The next thing **Yang** knew, his eyes re-opened with the girl's arms wrapped around him, speedily pulling him through the water and then airborne up and onto the [[Dawn Chaser]], which had made its way to the south side of the island, already prepared for sailing and ready to make way. As he lay on the deck of the ship, **Yang** looked up to see the 3 robed figures hovering above the ship along with the Drow female figure and the girl kneeling beside him.

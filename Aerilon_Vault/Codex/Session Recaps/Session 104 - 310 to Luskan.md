# Last we left off...

You made your way back to [[Sighi Thorgison]] who awaited your arrival at the docks of [[The Moonstone Mask]] island. You had just watched as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] summoned a celestial creature who transported [[Damien]] to an uninhabited island 400ft north. As you gathered yourselves at the docks once again as [[Gilas]] tied off the ferry, [[Sighi Thorgison]] expressed his apprehension once again to [[Teymir]] about [[Damien]]. In Thieve's Cant, he looked sideways in [[Asad Al-Nuri]]'s direction and told [[Teymir]] that "Religious types like this also have some higher agenda that they think is more righteous than anyone else's cause and they'll step over you if you get in the way of it. They don't know how to adapt their thinking if circumstances require it. And I don't trust no man who ain't willing to adapt." He told [[Teymir]] that [[Damien]] could very well be what exposes the [[Valkurians]] to the [[Everwatchers]], and he questioned what [[Teymir]] would do if it came down to [[Damien]] or [[Asad Al-Nuri]]. [[Teymir]] expressed that they would cross that bridge if they come to it.

[[Sighi Thorgison]] then joined you as you gathered yourselves back in [[The Moonstone Mask]] in one of your rooms to plan what is next. You talked with [[Sighi Thorgison]] for some time about what he knew about [[Jeremiah Phylund]]. He told you he knew that [[Phylund Works]] has been running shipments into [[Neverwinter]] for [[Lord Dagult Silverhand]] (who you know to be the ) from the [[Uncharted North]] for some time now. He doesn't know the nature of the shipments, but he thinks it's connected to a large excavation the [[Everwatchers]] are conducting somewhere in the wastes of the [[Uncharted North]] since not much else would really come from that region other than fish and [[Phylund Works]] doesn't own a fishing fleet. [[Sighi Thorgison]] also theorized that his work for [[Lord Dagult Silverhand]] is likely how he was able to fund the building of the [[Phylund Skyrail]] and likely many other cutting edge projects that has brought [[House Phylund]] renown in [[Aerilon]].

Hearing this about [[Jeremiah Phylund]], [[Teymir]] cautioned the party regarding whether or not you should continue pursuing the thread to frame [[Jeremiah Phylund]] for the catastrophe at [[Vos Industries]]. Instead, you began discussing if taking a more direct approach and stopping or diverting [[Arthund Jamas]]'s investigation would be the better course. You previously learned from [[Brandt]] that [[Arthund Jamas]]'s wife is sick, and you began to brainstorm how you might pull that thread.

You had a day or so more to spend in the city before the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]] train would arrive up from [[Waterdeep]]. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] visited [[Kinsley's Imports]] and used his connection to [[Gerard Vos]] to get a good deal on a new automatic pistol.

Meanwhile, after spending some time in the city and heading back to [[The Moonstone Mask]] aboard the [[Phylund Skyrail]], [[Gerard Vos]] noticed a woman with a wide-brimmed hat and fine suite sit down behind him. Once the sky rail arrived to [[The Moonstone Mask]] island, the woman stood up and placed her hand on [[Gerard Vos]]'s shoulder and said, "It's gonna be a good day, Gerard." [[Gerard Vos]] looked up to see the sockets of the woman's eyes were endlessly black. [[Gerard Vos]] quickly followed the woman through the crowd as they disembarked from the sky rail train. He caught up to the woman at the bottom of the station landing, got her attention, and saw her visage to once again be normal as the woman turned to him in confusion and then walked on. [[Gerard Vos]] then quickly reached for the card in his shirt pocket. He took it and threw it aboard the sky rail train before it left and watched it disembark. He immediately felt into his shirt pocket once again, surprised to no longer find the card instantly transported back there. He then waited the full half hour for the train to make its way back to the station. He looked onto the train once it arrived, to also find that the card was no longer on the floor where he threw it.

[[Gerard Vos]] then made his way back to [[The Moonstone Mask]], nodding his head at some of the armed men out front of the entrance when he saw three of the armed individuals look back at him with deep black eyes and smirks on their faces and quickly becoming normal in their visage as well in what seemed like the blink of an eye. [[Gerard Vos]] then entered the [[The Moonstone Mask]] once again to see the decorative entrance canopy cut to shreds on both sides as though large claws had eviscerated it. The rips in the cloth on both sides appeared to spell out an inscription that read, "I killed the bitch." [[Gerard Vos]] then watched as he entered into lobby as one after another, different black eyes of patrons looked at him and then quickly switched back to normal. 

As you prepared yourselves to board the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]], [[Brandt]] met with you once again to tell [[Gerard Vos]] that the [[Thayan]] prisoner who would be transported aboard the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]] was named [[Sadia Amos]] and would be escorted by a detail of [[Everwatch Knights]] as well as some members of [[House Grahlund]] who had apparently assisted in his apprehension and transport to [[Waterdeep]]. He also told you that it would likely only be nobles or others of high or wealthy station who would be aboard the train, leaving the standard cars open to separate first class from steerage where the prison would likely be kept.

You then passed your remaining time in [[Neverwinter]] until the time came to board the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]] train. [[Sighi Thorgison]] provided [[Teymir]] with the cloak that he promised him and told him to remember that he always remembers debts. [[Sighi Thorgison]] also provided [[Teymir]] with a communicator for keeping in touch.

You all handed over your tickets to the conductor as you entered the first class car, found your seats and listened as you heard the sound of electric buzzing and humming as the helm of the train sprang to life and you felt the entire train lift off of the ground a few inches and began to feel a slight vibration underneath your feet. The train then lurched forward as you began your 4 hour journey to [[Luskan]]. In the next few moments, a few nobles began walking to the bar in the first class car and filling the stools. [[Gerard Vos]] then heard the first class car door shuck open from behind you as a man entered wearing half moon spectacles, unkempt dark hair that hung about to his jaw line, wore loose fitting dark blue and white cloth garments, and carried a decorative flask in his hand. [[Gerard Vos]] watched as he walked over to the bartender and requested his flask be refilled. As he turned back around, he noticed [[Gerard Vos]] watching him. He proceeded to walk over, extend his hand, and say, "Hey there. I'm [[Murlough Grahlund]], nice to meet you."

And that's where we pick up....

# Last we left off...

A snow-covered battlefield became filled with chaos and destruction as what appeared to be a group of frost giants launched a surprise attack on your unsuspecting party and a large number of Everwatch Knights and other noble patrons.

The party was scattered across the battlefield as [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], [[Gerard Vos]], and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] found themselves lying in distributed places after jumping out of the plummeting train to safety.

In your respective quadrants of the battlefield you all watched as frost giants with varying martial and magic abilities towered over the [[Everwatch Knights]] in the distance who had already quickly exited the train to head off these hulking figures, whose icy skin glinted in dim light of the day as dusk approached. The giants' eyes were filled with a cold, merciless intent. They wielded massive battle axes with deadly precision, chopping through armor and flesh with ease as you see one knight after the other began to fall. 

[[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] engaged a female giant wearing heavy cloth garments and a thick hood, who carried a 15ft staff and appeared to have magical abilities when [[Teymir]] watched her channel her staff into the helm of the train itself, which seemed to charge the staff with electrical energy.

The [[Everwatch Knights]], caught off guard, struggled to defend themselves against the giants' onslaught. Some soldiers in the groups whirled their swords sending blasts of energy out of the blades as others began firing orbs of energy from their hands to slow the giants down.

Cries of war-fueled rage filled the air as the snow around was stained red with blood, and the ground littered with the bodies of the fallen. The giants' faces were savagely twisted as they seemed to revel in the slaughter unfolding.

As you all fought alonside the [[Everwatch Knights]] you saw an entire unit of knights routed by the cleaving swings of one of the giants when the commander of their unit bravely followed up with a greatsword attack that dealt a radiant mortal blow to the giant when he plunged his sword up through the giant's neck, sending him cascading to the ground like a massive oak tree.

Meanwhile, as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] found one another and then met up with [[Murlough Grahlund]] who was fighting a number of Shadowghasts who had surrounded him, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] saw a blinding flash of green energy fire out of a distance patch of trees, colliding into his armor, almost shattering it to pieces with incredible force as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] reeled from the heavy blow. After creating a wall of fire through the tree line, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] saw a humanoid form drop out of the trees and land on its feet--a form wearing a long crimson robe, with a shaved head, tribal tattoos covering the face, and solid black eye sockets. A fight ensued as the figure stared mercilessley in [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]]'s direction, firing multiple bolts of lightning through a large patch of dead trees as the two ran for cover.

It's a fight for survival, as the your party and the [[Everwatch Knights]] desperately try to hold off the giants and protect themselves from the cold and the giants seem bent on full scale destruction.

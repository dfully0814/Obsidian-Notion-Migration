#recap 

# Last we left off...
[[Yang Tieh]], [[Teymir]], [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]], and [[Azure Flint]] found themselves looking down dimly lit shaft beyond the mysteriously warded trap door **Yang** had previously opened by quietly speaking the word "Miriam". The group descended down a rusty ladder into a small 20x20 ft. room with a large circular hole in the middle with a metallic disc floating about 1ft. off the ground above it. **Azure** quickly ran and jumped onto the device, whisking him away in a puff of a blue smoke-like substance into the secret [[Valkurians]] cave below, soon to be followed by the rest of the party. Once in the cave, the group noticed the intricate and smooth stone architecture of the cave floor and interior of the walls, finding it strange that there would be such a man-made structure this deep under the water.

The group came across several 15x15 ft. iron cages containing different humanoid figures in various states of malnutrition. They found one elven woman with teal hair broken and bleeding while another man was sitting on the ground with a tree branch-like tattoo traveling from the middle of his forehead and up to the middle of his head. Turning and seeing **Yang**, the man stood with what was left of his strength and attempted to hurl a large ball of light at **Yang** through the bars of the cage. To the man's surprise, the bars of the cage absorbed the impact of the spell, dispersing the energy of the ball of light throughout the bars and then backfiring back into the man's body.

As the man dropped to his knees, **Teymir** noticed a strange and subtle vibration coming off him, prompting him to speak to the man and see what he could do to help. In turn, the man told **Teymir** to leave him alone and later replied to **Teymir's** message, **"Go to hell, Valkurian."** As they passed through the cave to the south, the party saw more large cages containing more humanoid figures, eventually coming to a dead-end and large cavern where they quickly realized they had walked into a trap. The party saw several humans tied and bound lined up along the edge of a 10ft cliff guarded by a mysterious Drow woman dressed in a long black leather dress, tall headdress, viking-like ceremonial makeup, and a long black staff with purple orb on the end.

Below the cliff in the center of the room was an elven girl, looking to be around 13 years of age, with long white hair, a jade green dress, and cerulean eyes. She was being guarded by a large number of [[Drow]] warriors prominently dressed in black and purple armor with the same spider symbol prominently engraved on their chest plates as the symbol on **Teymir's** lyre and the dwarf-like creature **Azure** fought The party watched as **Captain Moonlight** casually walked up to the foot of the cliff where the Drow woman stood, and said, "Tell Lyrala our business has concluded. A deal is a deal", to which the Drow woman nodded and turned over a man to **Moonlight** named [[Aryn Hest]], who you heard her implicate in the death of her father and tell him, I'm going to destroy everything Khan ([[Talir Khan]]) built, make him watch, and then kill him slowly.

The man responded by whimpering and saying, Avareen, I was just a deckhand on the [[Harrier]], we had no idea what he was going to do. To this, **Moonlight** proceeded to shoot the man in the head at point-blank range and walk out of the cavern, saying to Yang **Don't be too long.** The Drow woman told the party she had been expecting them and proceeded to invade **Teymir's** mind, forcing him to hand the lyre over to her and kill what later turned out to be an [[Everwatcher]] noble figure who was confined in one of the middle hanging cages in the cavern When she tried to invade **Azure's** mind, she was unsuccessful, resulting in **Azure** tackling **Teymir** to the ground, releasing him from her dark hold on his mind. In her furious anger over having been rarely outmatched, she cast a deadly volley of purple lightning at **Teymir** and **Azure** only to watch the lightning energy arc across the room and into the body of the young girl, which began to form an increasingly violent storm inside of the cavern.

The Drow woman, in her desperation to keep the party from stealing the girl, held up a menacing black orb in both hands and threw it to the cavern floor. The party realized the violent shaking of the ground and the heat had been emanating from this orb. The party began fighting their way out of the storm and around the Drow guards who were also desperately driving to survive as **Yang**, with his expert ability to stare down calamity while maintaining control of mind and body, pieced together that the asset was **the girl** and not an object. He proceeded to grab her from her levitated state above the ground and quickly make his way out of the storm as well. As the party exited the storm to the enraged screams of the Drow woman, one final and dry wave of heat swept through the cavern, seeming to suck all the air out of its tunnels as the ground began to violently quake, this time without ceasing. Bruised, bleeding, thirsty, and exhausted the party began desperately scrambling back out of the cavern the way they came with the girl in tow.

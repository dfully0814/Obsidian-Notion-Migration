# Last we left off...

Noticing that [[Kaya]] had disappeared from the camp, concerned for his safety and the potential threat of what might have become of him or what he might have found, [[Yang Tieh]] ventured from your camp and encountered a halfling man named [[Pippal]]. Meanwhile, while sleeping soundly and unaware, [[Teymir]] sensed a presence inviting him forward. As he willingly accepted, he was soon nudged awake to realize he had been transported 500ft away from the camp and was face to face with a half-elf girl who later introduced herself as Elleanna.

She told [[Teymir]] she was on a mission and that this group was that mission, offering not much other detail to Teymir other than that she would like to join the group and could be a help to them. Seeing fairly quickly that Teymir was understandably wary of allowing a stranger into the party, [[Elleanna Corvus]] told Teymir that she wanted to present him with a token of goodwill to show that she could be trusted. She held out a small circular wood music box in her hand with a flower carved into the lid. As Teymir opened the lid, he saw a small circular platform raise with a gray and white bird attached to a metal rod that was vertically protruding from the platform. The music box began to play a gentle melody as the bird began flapping its wings.

Teymir began to smell the increasingly strong scent of freshly-cut wood as he found himself transported through a seemingly infinite black tunnel filled with glowing blue orbs all around him. He eventually flew into one of these orbs, and saw a scene form in front of him of a boy in thick work pants and a work shirt sitting on a floor covered in wood shavings with piles of wood planks of various sizes, colors, and cuts stacked in one corner of the room. He saw a large 7ft tall man standing at a work bench on the opposite side of the room sawing into a large wooden block also wearing thick work pants, shirt, and a carpenter apron. As Teymir was looking through this boy's eyes, he saw that the boy was holding the music box and tears were falling down onto dusty hands holding it. Seeing his sadness, the large man turned and began comforting the boy, saying:

> Oh, little fire all things must die. Our purpose is not to live forever but to create something that will. I know that you loved [[Rushnaa]] and love has a way of permanence about it. It places a mark on what might be lost and makes it as unchanging as the love in your heart. [[Rushnaa]] will never be truly lost because you loved her. Those who are loved are never truly lost are they? You love with the fierceness of giants little fire. It will cause you great pain, but will be a light for many.

Stunned, [[Teymir]] began imploring [[Elleanna Corvus]] where she got the music box from, to which she replied that she's not able to divulge that information to him. Meanwhile, as [[Azure Flint]] and [[John Smith]] continued sleeping, they were suddenly attacked for a 10ft tall humanoid tree-like creature that seemed to have a ravenous hunger for life. Teymir and Elleanna rushed back to the camp to aid in the fight. After an intense battle with the creature, the party eventually managed to defeat it.

John Smith later investigated some of the left over roots of the creature, squeezing them and watching as human blood oozed from them. Afterward, Azure saw that Teymir had brought a stranger into the camp, he became increasingly incensed, thinking that this somehow was connected with Teymir's pursuit of uncovering his past. Teymir assured him that Elleanna could be trusted. Azure then walked away as the three took a short respite in the case

Azure then confronted Yang about leaving the camp, which sparked an increasingly volatile stand-off between Yang and Azure, erupting into physical blows leveled against one another. Azure asked Teymir to give him a reason not to kill Yang, to which [[Teymir]] replied, "Hit him again." As the second set of exchanged blows erupted, Teymir fired two blasts of radiant energy into Yang, knocking him back into the dense foliage of the forest. Suddenly, Teymir turned to see Kaya barreling toward him, knocking him prone and standing over him awaiting Yang's next command.

Azure then back walking back to the camp in Teymir's direction. He grabbed Teymir, pulling him from under [[Kaya]], picked him up, and began punching him repeatedly with a black coldness in his eyes unable to hide the furious rage underneath. Bewildered and shocked by the turn of events, Teymir opted not to fight back as Azure continued advancing, soon knocking him prone and began bludgeoning the back of his head on the ground as Teymir looked up in continued shock and confusion as the rest of the party also watched in less potent shock and confusion.

Teymir's grip on his glass staff soon went limp as his hand opened, dropping the staff on the ground and falling unconscious. With tears dropping from his face, seeing that he had brought Teymir to the threshold of death, Azure stabilized Teymir but leaving him unconscious. And that's where we pick up. Teymir lies on the ground bludgeoned and unconscious with Azure straddling his unconscious body while the rest of the party looks onâ€¦

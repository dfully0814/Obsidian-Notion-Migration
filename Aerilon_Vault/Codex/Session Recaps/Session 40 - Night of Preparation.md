# Last we left off...

You spend the rest of the night in [[Baraksur]] preparing for your fight in the arena with the brothers of [[Insk]]. [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] made their way down into the city square to inspect the arena itself, seeing carousing and chaos before them all across the city as [[Tiefling]] slaves were ravished, [[Hobgoblin]]s seemed to fight with one another, and white-skinned figures with fully pronounced [[Draconic]] features looked on at strategic points around the city.

While inspecting the arena, you discovered a series of four obelisks they seemed alien in nature in their construction. The arena was presided over by seating carved into the large cavern ceiling. You learned from your slaves that the arena conditions of victory often change and the conditions within it, both in terms of atmosphere and obstacles often change. You also learned no one from the outside who are not participating are allowed in.

After inspecting the arena, Ell pulled Teymir aside and confronted him regarding his decision engage in combat with Insk in the first place, resulting in his falling unconscious. She harshly warned him that he better run this time in the arena if he finds himself in a similar disadvantageous position and not try to be a hero.

Meanwhile, a pair of Hobgoblins that had become addicted to what they referred to as "root" burst into [[Klovag]]'s home, demanding to speak with him and demanding that he give them more. Instead, [[Yang Tieh]] convinced them the black liquid in his vials was the root in liquid form. The Hobgoblins consumed it little forethought, resulting in their bodies soon being consumed by a putrid fungus, which Yang studied.

On the way back to Klovag's home, Teymir attempted to make a wager with a Hobgoblin named [[Grozren]] who seemed to dislike [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] and also didn't seem to exhibit any of the Draconic features as many of the other Hobgoblins have. He asked Grozren for help to do something about Blazbaard if the newcomers were to win in the arena, and he would give him the two slaves if they lost. It wasn't clear if the wager was accepted by him or not as he told Teymir that he might just kill him and take his slaves anyway if the newcomers lost.

While attempting to attune to her newly acquired mask, Ell had a vision of a shadowy figure with white hair who confronted her on her progress infiltrating the group. The figure warned her not to get attached and told her that attachments would make her weak. The figure also granted her the ability to extract memories from those whom she has killed in and store them away for later reference and access.

As the night came to a close, Klovag took some of the black liquid Yang offered him for further study and also shared that [[Arharzel]], the white dragon, is being held against his will.

The next morning as you awoke to a fish breakfast prepared by Klovag, Klovag shared with Yang that slavers from [[Thornhold]] make regular runs into the mountains when he found out that Yang was from Thornhold. He left the house to go make final preparations for the arena event, telling you that you would be summoned at the appropriate time.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

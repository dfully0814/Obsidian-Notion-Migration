The party saw a mysterious figure sitting on the dock with a dead body behind him who turned out to be a mysterious man named "Yang". [[Yang Tieh]] told the group that he was a member of the [[Valkurians]] cell in [[Thornhold]] and that he had come to the lighthouse in search of [[Lucien Skyhorn]]. [[Teymir]] told [[Yang Tieh]] that  [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] may be here for more than the [[Jade Lion]].

[[Teymir]] and [[Azure Flint]] explored the base of the island in a row boat. [[Teymir]] saw a cove in the distance along the coast. Azure dove into the water and saw an underwater tunnel running from the lighthouse island base out into the distance (seemingly to the coast)

Yang opened the front door of the lighthouse, which was unlocked and saw two [[Drow]] sitting at a table in the main hall. Moonlight ran to duck for cover and Yang stood out in front as battle ensued. Teymir and Yang mention not trusting Moonlight. Said their job is to find Lucien and recover the asset. Yang doesn't like the company Teymir brought with him. Said it's in his interest to be assisted by them.

Yang said Teymir has the support of Thornhold Yang says [[Waterdeep]] runs a little different than how things are done in Thornhold. He's cautious about Azure's recklessness. Yang says he doesn't like disloyalty and threatens to handle Azure if he's disloyal. Teymir says, "Be careful Yang." Yang peered into the lighthouse from the front door to see to Drow figures sitting at a table in the main hall. Combat ensued.

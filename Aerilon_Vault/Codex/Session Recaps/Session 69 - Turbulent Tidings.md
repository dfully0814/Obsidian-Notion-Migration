#recap 
# Last we left off...
[[Elleanna Corvus]] burst forth back into your campsite along with a frigid and suffocating deluge of sea water. As she lay on the ground, as soon as she had the breath in her to speak, she started frantically exclaiming that you all needed to get to [[Thornhold]].

[[Teymir]] was the first to approach her, help her off the ground, and then magically remove the water from her body to avoid longer term detriment from the cold. She began to recount the story of [[Galladon]] and her meeting with The [[The Guide]]. As she recounted the details, Teymir noticed a running theme throughout her account of wanting to help her father no matter what it takes. This seemed to somewhat concern Teymir regarding the lengths Ell might be willing to go as he later discussed all the party learned with Yang and Azure. Ell then asked Teymir for [[Kwalish]]'s journal, walked away and began studying the journal, seeming to not want to be bothered.

Meanwhile, [[Azure Flint]] and [[Halia Thornton]] began a conversation regarding what is ahead for Halia. As they both drank in front of the campire, Halia began despairingly asking Azure what the point was of all the things they've done up to this point, telling him that if there's a Hell they both know they're headed there. Azure responded by telling Halia that if there is indeed a final judgment then all you can do is do what you can do with the time you have left. They both struggled with one another to find a point and meaning in anything. Halia told Azure she wouldn't be able to go to [[Tamerland Quixat]] with nothing and that she'd still like to run the magical axe for him. Halia asked Azure if he wanted to disappear with her. Azure responded by telling her for now hanging with the group seems to be what he needs to do. She told him not to get himself killed and she hopes it wouldn't be so long until she's able to see him again.

As several of you began removing your clothing drenched in seawater to be dried by Teymir, Teymir noticed a familiar tattoo that spanned the entirety of [[Gerard Vos]]' back—a tattoo of the symbol of the [[Scourgers]]—the exact same as the one on Teymir's wrist. After questioning Vos about his knowledge of the Scourgers and how he came to get the tattoo, Vos told him that the symbol was the insignia of an old military unit he used to be a part of. Vos mentioned not having heard of the Scourgers. Overwhelmed by the volume of information shared by Ell, Teymir didn't press further.

Your group also discussed the fortune teller for the first time and how Vos and Azure both came by her black cards.

You slept the night and morning came. Halia said her goodbyes, taking Azure's axe, and left. You continued in the direction of [[Leilon]] and ultimately the [[Sword Coast]]. As you began to come near to the coast after several days of travel, you began to enter into a raging storm of rain, window, sometimes deafening thunder clasps, and large water spouts you could see through the night time strobing of lightning strikes. You saw a fleet of 50 or so [[Everwatchers]] ships escorted by about 20 bird-like machines above them, each ship and flying machine surrounded by an orange sphere, all seeming to sail deeper into the storm.

As you continued onto the shoreline, Azure was the first to realize from his many perilous journeys in these conditions that you likely wouldn't last long walking at night. He also began to notice the lightning strikes were very unnatural in how often they were appearing and how sporadically, giving off an air of intense instability. Azure remembered that there was a system of caves along the perimeter of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] where seafairing folk often seek refuge who can't afford better lodging or to prepare for a longer journey on land.

You made your way to the caves when you saw a hooded figure fighting for his life against a group of figures made of shadow, each seeming to wield different martial weapons also made of shadow. The hooded figure wielded a sword that had lightning arcing up and down the blade and you watched as he frequently fire lightning out of his sword and then traveled down the bolt of lightning to dodge the attacks of the shadows.

Realizing that he was mostly fighting defensively, Yang and Teymir decided to rush in to provide help. After dispatching three of the shadows, the figure lead you to where he said he was staying in the very caves you were already heading to. As you entered and found his antechamber, you saw a female [[Drow]] sitting on the floor of the cave in front of a campfire holding an infant Drow child. The female's hair was white with Auburn colored highlights, wearing common clothing. The hooded figure turned to you, pulled back his hood, as you saw a Drow man with short white spiked hair and battle scars covering his face to the point that they made him look middle aged even though it seemed like he might only be in his early 30's in human terms.

He told you that he and his family were refugees from [[Kheldell]] where they had sought refuge after he defected from a Thayan military unit. He told you that the [[Thayans]] have become ruthless in searching for mysterious holy artifacts, some of which they believed to be in the city of [[Sember]] in the prosperous neutral country of [[Cormanthyr]]. After being ordered to slaughter men, women, and children, he had enough. He also told you the Thayans have dispatched what he referred to as a "[[Retriever]]" to hunt him down to either maim and kill him or apprehend him and bring him back to Thay, which he things would likely be worse than death. He told you that he's only been able to elude the Retriever this long because of the seeming planar anomalies. He mentioned the closer he stays to them the more it seems to disrupt the Retriever's ability to track him. He mentioned to you that he's now only 5 or 6 hours ahead of it by his estimation.

He began to beg your group for help to protect his family, telling you that he has [[Auril]] to help him and has prayed for her favor and he believes this storm and your appearance is her answer.

And that's where we pick up....

#recap 
# Last we left off...
Gathering yourselves in the middle of an ancient and dark stairwell, [[Leowin Moonflower]]'s lifeless body laid before you. After sharing with the party about his daughter Ella, what happened to her, and apologizing to the party for how he's been carrying himself, [[Tanavast Adamantus]] concluded that the [[Shadovar]] “would pay” if they were somehow involved in what happened to Leowin. He then took her and buried her beneath a pile of rubble in the diorama room, writing on the grave, "here lies the broken goddess." [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Teymir]] investigated the bodies of the tentacled creatures in the room, noticing their very otherworldly nature and finding themselves unable to compare it to another singular animal they have seen. Yang was able to successfully collect some of the slime dripping from one of the tentacled creature's pincers into an empty vial. The party then laid down for a night's rest in the diorama room.

A few hours later, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] became overcome by something that seemed to begin violently attack their nervous systems, causing Yang to become paralyzed temporarily and Tanavast to become severely nauseated and vomit profusely. Filled with a mix of panic and frustration, [[Teymir]] entered the diorama room calling out to whatever entities he believed to be listening asking what they wanted, receiving no reply. Tanavast soon then sensed that every statue in the room had an otherworldly nature close to the point when Teymir placed the tentacled statue back in its place in the middle diorama. [[Azure Flint]] then entered the room, seeing Teymir placing the statue in its place. Azure rejected Teymir's request to also place the stolen gold back onto the diorama, which eventually resulted in a conflict between Azure and Teymir in which Azure repeatedly cast shatter spells against the middle stone structure and tentacled statue on the ground near it and statues still sitting on the diorama itself. He was soon successful, the damage to the base of the stone diorama being significant enough that the diorama toppled to the ground, and all the statues were either broken in half, severely cracked, or shattered to pieces. No longer able to sense a process among the broken statues in the middle of the room, Tanavast began smashing all the other statues in the dioramas around the perimeter of the room.

The party then took a long rest in the oppressive darkness and silence of the room you started in, except Teymir and Azure who were sleeping in the hallway. As [[John Smith]] took point during this rest period, he noticed a small girl standing in the middle of the octagonal room, who then walked forward toward the eastern door of the room. He chose to follow her, discovering in the process that the double doors separating the octagonal room from the hallway had some property about them that held back whatever essence seems to pervade the rooms you've entered so far. Teymir soon convinced John Smith to return to the pursuit didn't continue.

While sleeping, Tanavast had a dream of a long staircase seemingly suspended in thin air. As he ascended the staircase in what appeared to be [[Everwatch Knights]] armor, he saw a figure at the top of the steps who was dressed exactly like him with sword extended and shield in hand. In his own voice, seemingly speaking in his head, the figure told him that he was a coward, scoffed at his willingness to do what needed to be done, remarked "what about the sorcerer", "you can become me" as Tanavast saw a dark orange essence begin swirling around the figure's feet. Before waking up, the figure lastly remarked, "you can still save her, you know."

The party then made their way to the western door of the octagonal, down the hallway, and into a room that appeared to have been used for the worship of some ancient beastial-like gods. The room contained whole and broken statues stuck in the mud all over the room, the same slime material covering the walls as you've seen before. The party saw a metallic pyramid sitting on the only whole pedestal remaining in the room with a constellation above it that [[Azure Flint]] recognized as a bird-like mythological god of lightning and storms that are often observed by sailors and sea folk. As [[Yang Tieh]] interacted with this pyramid, he watched as lightning from his hands seemed to be stirred back contact with this pyramid, sparks arcing into the pyramid, and causing the constellation about the pyramid pedestal to glow. As [[Tanavast Adamantus]] tried to sense any additional otherworldly presence in this room he noticed an ethereal strand pointing into Teymir's body, taking both Tanavast and Teymir aback. Teymir, you've searched vigorously--associating with unsavory organizations, people, and places for any clue about who you are, where you come from, and now your first real clue has been unexpectedly revealed to you. What do you do?

# Last we left off...
[[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Galladon]] began walking toward an armory which would become a temporary training room after speaking with [[The Guide]] and ending the very heated confrontation they just had. As they walked, [[Elleanna Corvus]] asked [[Galladon]] what he meant when he said that the last person he ever cared about died on his knees. [[Galladon]] told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that person was his father. [[Elleanna Corvus]] chose not to press further when [[Galladon]] concluded by saying, "We're going to stop [[House Xorlarrin]] before they can destroy anymore lives." The two entered the armory and began their training. 

After finishing the training, [[Galladon]] asked [[Elleanna Corvus]] if she was ready to go back and cautioned her about not making the same mistake again. He told her that he knew many in [[Aerilon]] feared a gift such as hers and that he knew she was often in great danger, particularly from the [[Everwatchers]]. He gave her two vials of a purple liquid that he told her would cause her to forget her magical abilities for a short time that would be long enough from even the most powerful magic user. The caveat, however, is that she will also forget that she even knows magic for that time.

He told her that he would be watching over her as he began drawing a geometric shape on the ground that lit up in a fiery purple outline once he completed it. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then stepped onto the center of the shape as she began to feel a tremendous gravitational force against her body as the flames grew taller and the room around her became more dim until only [[Galladon]]'s figure remained and then disappeared as well.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]], [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], [[Gerard Vos]], and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] traveled back into the [[Paramount]]'s submarine to prepare venturing to shore when [[Lyra]] cautioned that the sub's fuel capacity had reached 15%. [[Lyra]] informed you that the closest area where you might find more [[Blueshift]] fuel cells would be on the island continent of [[Lantan]] out in the western sea.

You then chose to submerge the submarine 60ft deep in the ocean and swim back up to the surface and make your way to the shore and began to approach the southwest gate leading into the city of [[Neverwinter]]. At the gate, you saw a number of [[Everwatch Knights]] supported by a robed figure and large automatons with long bulky arms and broad shoulders. The robed figure held a dark orange orb that they past over each individual before allowing them into the city. 

As your group approached, one of the [[Everwatch Knights]] walked forward, stopped you, and asked what your purpose was and where you had come from. You told the knight that you were trying to escape the storm. Noticing that [[Asad Al-Nuri]] carried a book that appeared religious, the knight asked him where we came from, and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] told the knight he comes from [[Kerruma]] and shared some regarding his religion. Immediately, the knight responded by saying, "Take him to the judge in the [[Hall of Justice]] for questioning." At this command, three knights began escorting [[Asad Al-Nuri]] into the city and out of sight from the rest of the party.

A few knights came back through the gate to replace the knights who had left, one of them quickly noticing [[Gerard Vos]] and telling him that he never knew he'd be this happy to see his ugly face. [[Gerard Vos]] recognized the voice as [[Brandt]]'s as he took off his metal helmet. He quickly escorted [[Gerard Vos]] and the rest of the party into the city and began to anxiously ask [[Gerard Vos]] if he knew what had happened to [[Vos Industries]]. He told him that the secret operation and R&D factories located in [[Luskan]] had burned to the ground and large swathes of the employees at each site and turned on one another in riotous fashion. He told [[Gerard Vos]] that the [[Everwatchers]] have begun an investigation at the site and warned [[Gerard Vos]] what could happen if some of the more secret underground facilities are discovered.

[[Gerard Vos]] shared with [[Brandt]] that he intended to travel over to [[The Moonstone Mask]] in the city to lay low for a while but would need some new clothes for he and the party. [[Brandt]] recommended going to see [[Jenny]] in the [[Protector's Enclave]] as she might could help. You then traveled to [[Jenny]]'s home, who the rest of the party discovered to be an old and disgruntled halfling woman who was a long-time associated of [[Gerard Vos]]. After answering the door by sticking a shotgun in his face, she began to scold [[Gerard Vos]] about how much heat has brought down on her home and how she can't even go out of the house without fear of someone questioning her regarding her relationship to him.

She eventually calmed down and agreed to give [[Gerard Vos]] some leftover equipment she had in her basement as well as some dress clothes imported from [[Kara-Tur]] for the group. She told [[Gerard Vos]] she would be there if he needed anything.

You all then made your way to [[The Moonstone Mask]] via the [[Phylund Skyrail]]. As you were en-route to the mansion, you felt an object drop onto the outside of the top of your car as [[Elleanna Corvus]] found herself holding for dear life on top of the skyrail car until it came to a stop when she was immediately thrown from the car to the ground and then trampled on by the surging crowd of people exiting the rail cars from all sides. The party met up with her and found that she began demanding to not speak in public no matter what kinds of questions the group began to ask. You all then made your way to the mansion where you were questioned by some of the staff. When [[Gerard Vos]]' name could not be found on the approved list, he mentioned that he was here to see [[Ophala Marget]] and that she would know who he is. After a few moments, a member of the staff came back confirming that [[Ophala Marget]] knew him and his group was okay to enter.

The group then entered into a decadent 5-story mansion bedecked in East-Asian aesthetic, with fountains distributed throughout the entry space, open bar, and sitting area near a decorative hearth. You saw the staff were all wearing black gowns, with white moonstone masks over their faces, and each also wore identical golden amulets around their necks. [[Gerard Vos]] explained to the group that the staff never speak and remain entirely anonymous.

A member of the wait staff walked up to your group, and you let her know that you would like two rooms, and she wrote down to you that it would cost 50 gold pieces. When [[Gerard Vos]] told her she can put that on his tab, she reached out her hand to collect immediately. You then made your way to rooms 205 and 206 where [[Teymir]] managed to summon [[Rushnaa]] once again. As [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Gerard Vos]] entered their room to rest, [[Teymir]] was unable to find [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] who appeared to have wandered off. [[Rushnaa]] stands on the floor in [[Teymir]]'s room where she has told him that she was wondering when she would see him again, and that she has not been able to reach him for quite some time.

And that's where we pick up....

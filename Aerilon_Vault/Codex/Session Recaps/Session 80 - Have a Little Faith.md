# Last we left off...
As you traversed further into the cave, [[Teymir]] decided to send [[Rushnaa]] out to scout ahead. As she scouted, Rushnaa came to a series of dead bodies lying on the ground with blackened skin similar to the less evolved [[Shadowghasts]] you've encountered before. As Rushnaa looked on, a arachnid-like creature with sharp pincer legs and a humanoid-like face and spines of hair on its back resembling human hair crawled out of the side of the cave wall and began to eat on some of the bodies lying on the ground, appearing to pierce the bodies with a sharp beak on its face and drain the black liquid that issued forth from the bodies.

You then came to a large metal door leading to what appeared to be a room made to look like an [[Aviary]] filled with flying scarab beetles that glowed blue and orange as they flew and alighted onto the large amount of foliage filling the room. You also saw a very tall, gaunt, very old [[Drow]] figure sitting at a desk to the opposite of the room. However, looking through his lens at the figure, [[Gerard Vos]] saw a different form--that of a four-legged bestial creature with large folded wings. The figure seemed to be working at the desk with a host of various alchemist implements and devices. You also noticed a prominent silver circlet with glowing blue gems on the desk next to the figure.

[[Yang Tieh]] lead forward as you began to knock on the door, prompting the figure to inquisitively investigate you, eventually allowing you to enter, seemingly due more to curiosity than anything else. The old Drow introduced himself as [[Abrak Vraelo]]. He seemed to have a loyal devotion to [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], whom he described as the "Matron Mother" of [[House Xorlarrin]]. He told you that she once saved his life when he was captured by [[Drow]] of [[House Baenre]] and experimented upon. He also mentioned that Matron Lyrala is attempting to save the Xhorlarrin people from [[Nulmoria]] by using the power of the [[Sirin Beacons]] to reform their sliver of existence with yours to fix the devastation wrought by the Sirin. He seemed to have some level of previous devotion to the Sirin by seems to have now mostly lost any faith in their ability and benevolence.

[[Teymir]] then began to connect with him regarding their mutual interest in the Sirin, showing him Rushnaa which seemed to peek Abrak's interest but not do much for his faith in them, seeing the meekness of Rushnaa's frame and power. Teymir managed to persuade Abrak to allow your group to help him. He reluctantly agreed, pleading with you not to harm her telling you he believes her intentions to be noble and an admirable display of strength and resolve. He seemed to agree primarily because of a residual hope in him that the Sirin may be somehow returning.

To aid you, he offered to teleport you to a central area in the cavern beyond without you needing to exit through the opposite heavy iron door in the room. He told you that there should be remnant faithful to the [[Sirin]] that you may come across in the citadel who haven't yet been "twisted" by their presence in this world. He also warned that if seen by the majority of individuals in this citadel you would be attacked on sight. He also gave Teymir a swarm of beetles which swarmed around Teymir's body, forming a glowing blue cape around his shoulders and flowing to the ground.

He also warned you that in the next cavern you will likely encounter various prisoners the [[House Xorlarrin]] have taken and told you that the prison cells would likely be trapped with magic to protect anyone getting close to the cells. After teleporting you to the next cave, you began to hear patrols walking around in the cave and the sound of carefree humming of an elderly woman in a dark antechamber. In this chamber you also saw the floor covered with large eggs with a glowing green light coming from the center. All seemed to be interconnected and connected to the cave walls by large roots that seemed to pulse like veins.

While attempting to circumvent one of the patrols and continue through the cave, you were seen by one of the guards which resulted in one of the [[Drow]] mage figures attacking [[Gerard Vos]], wrapping him in dark purple lightning, eventually knocking him unconscious. Combat has now ensued with this guard patrol as you stand somewhere in this dark cave, knowing there are likely other patrols somewhere in your vicinity.

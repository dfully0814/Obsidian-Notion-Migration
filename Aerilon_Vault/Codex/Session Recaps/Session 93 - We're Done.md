#recap 
# Last we left off...
The fight between [[Yang Tieh]] and what appeared to be an otherworldly copy of him continued in an oval-shaped room with glowing green spheres of concentrated necrotic energy all around on top of tall pillars. As the fight between the two continued, each anticipating the other's movements and counter-attacking, large areas of the floor began to open up revealing an endless, starry expanse below. The two had to repeatedly dodge being pulled into these expanses as they opened.

Soon, the two combatants brought each other passed the point of death as both began to expend their remaining ki energy to hold onto life a few seconds longer to exact a final blow with their spears. When it appeared that [[Yang Tieh]] had depleted his last remaining ki, his dark copy looked at him blankly through a yin-yang mask and said, "Why do you struggle on so? You can't win. Just give up. What are you fighting for?" to which [[Yang Tieh]] replied, "My friends. They need me. And I need them." At this point, the dark figure lunged at [[Yang Tieh]] with his spear as [[Yang Tieh]] dodged the thrust and dove off of the pillar they were standing on, plummeting into the endless starry expanse below and denying the figure the final blow.

Meanwhile, in the stairwell near the wine cellar of the [[Cassalanter Mountain Villa]], [[Teymir]] stood between an enraged [[Elleanna Corvus]] as she attempted to attack [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]. [[Teymir]] watched as [[Elleanna Corvus]] stood up after he shoved her against the wall and began mumbling, "No. no. no. Not again..." to herself as she looked down and her hair hung over her face. Suddenly, illusions of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]], [[Klovag]], and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] appeared on each side of her in succession as she continued mumbling and eventually screaming in what sounded like emotional agony. [[Teymir]] attempted to talk to her to calm her. Realizing that it was no good, [[Teymir]] then attempted to reach out to comfort her as his arms passed through her body as though she too was an illusion. Directly following this, [[Teymir]] heard the sound of a high-pitched sound growing ever louder followed by a sudden sonic blast that blew back [[Teymir]] and [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] who was near him in the wine cellar hallway. The blast carried with it the appearance of [[Galladon]]'s figure standing directly in front of [[Elleanna Corvus]]. As he lay on the ground, [[Teymir]] looked up to see [[Galladon]] firmly grasp [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s wrist, turn his head back to [[Teymir]] and say, "She doesn't belong here," at which point [[Galladon]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] both disappeared in a flash of purple light.

With both [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Yang Tieh]] now gone, the rest of the party reconvened at the kitchen adjacent to the underground stairwell leading to the wine cellar. Before anyone could speak, [[Teymir]] interjected and said, "[[Yang Tieh]]'s gone, [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s gone. We're done. We're going back to the sub. And we're leaving. This mission's over." [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] attempted to convince [[Gerard Vos]] to stay on with him and complete the mission to acquire the beacon, but [[Gerard Vos]] decided to remain with the party. [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] wished the party luck and handed [[Gerard Vos]] a communicator and told him he would give him a call when he was ready to call in the favor [[Gerard Vos]] had promised. Before leaving, [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] cautioned [[Gerard Vos]] not to be anywhere near the area if the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] get the upper hand in this conflict as they will wipe the memories of everyone regarding what had happened here.

The party watched as [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] walked in the opposite direction headed toward the [[House Xorlarrin Citadel]]. [[Teymir]], [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], and [[Gerard Vos]] began a despairing and morose hike from the [[Cassalanter Mountain Villa]] back down the steep mountain connecting to the shores from which you came into this area. The party passed by the [[Everwatch Knights]] camp in the distance, seeing a large force gathering for a presumed massive assault on the citadel, pressing forward in what was to be your mission and a key to answers for many of you.

The party arrived safely to the submarine, finding it where it had been left as [[Lyra]] identified the group and allowed access back into the sub. Using [[Lyra]] to now pilot the submarine in ultra-quiet mode, the party set a course for the [[Paramount]], which remains submerged deep in the [[Sea of Swords]].

With a number of days ahead to arrive to the [[Paramount]], [[Teymir]] tried to converse with [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] to understand what had happened to him and how he ended up in [[Nulmoria]]. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] seemed to not understand the concept of a "past" or discussing anything leading up to when he arrived in [[Nulmoria]]. He also shared with [[Teymir]] that everyone seems to recall arriving in the same shoreline area that the party just left, but no one really cares to discuss what came before but only what lies ahead and what their purpose in it is. 

And that's where we pick up....

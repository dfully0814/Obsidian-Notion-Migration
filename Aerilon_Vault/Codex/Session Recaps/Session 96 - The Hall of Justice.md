# Last we left off...
[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] continued to explore [[The Moonstone Mask]] on his own, traversing up the next several floors. On the third floor, he came across a decadent museum of sorts called [[The Moonstone Emporium]] with lines of people wrapped around both sides of a central structure in the center of the floor waiting to get in. Curious to see what was inside, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] found a place in line where we met a man named [[Jeremiah Phylund]], who appeared to be a man of great prestige and wealth in [[Neverwinter]]. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] recognized his last name as the same name attached to the skyrail you had taken to get to the [[The Moonstone Mask]].

After entering the emporium, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] made his way around the outside of the room and looked at the series of mysterious artifacts locked behind glass cases inset into the wall. A few of the noteworthy artifacts he came across were the following:
- A decorative painting by [[Ryujin Ishikawa]] completed days before his mysterious disappearance
- A petrified rose that belonged to [[Balmora Rageen]] in the time of the [[Netherese]] said to be given her by [[Telamont Tanthul]] during a local celebration of the installation of a new enclave
- An iron oil lamp with tiny gemstones inset into it forming constellations that is said to have been recovered from the far reaches of the [[Uncharted North]]. The plaque said the whispers of [[Auril]] guide the lost traveler in the deepest darkness who carries it with them.
- Two bronze rings joined by a decorative chain said to have been forged from the first high rises built in [[Waterdeep]] during the Industrial Revolution of [[Aerilon]]
- A single cloth glove embroidered with the initials A.B. said to be part of the dress attire customarily worn by a member of the mysterious [[Council of Eight]] in [[Thay]]. Believed to have belonged to the council's founder, [[Alina Baenre]]
- A steel tuning fork said to make no sound and transport a knowledgeable user to an alien world

The final item [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] observed alongside [[Jeremiah Phylund]], which was named "Shrieking Chalk." [[Jeremiah Phylund]] told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] he was interested in this piece because it was the last remains recovered from the lecture hall of [[Professor Jopha Masym]] in the university of [[Candlekeep]]. He told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] that the professor was a mentor of his when he attended the university and that the professor destroyed his life after the tragic death of his daughter including the unexplained destruction of his lecture hall and nearby areas of the university. He explained it was his intention to acquire the chalk and sell it at an exorbitant profit in order to restore the professor's lecture hall as a memorial to him and his legacy. As they parted ways, he also told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] to ask for him if he needed any work.

Meanwhile, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] was brought into the [[Hall of Justice]] where he came before [[Judge Oleff Uskar]] and a gold-masked figure as well as an [[Arcane Brotherhood]] figure who was immediately able to tell that he had magical abilities. The judge pushed back when the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] figure insistently said that [[Asad Al-Nuri]] should be cleansed, saying it was not in the best diplomatic interest of the city to cleanse someone from [[Kerruma]] with whom [[Aerilon]] currently maintains a crucial trading relationship during this time of war with [[Thay]]. [[Judge Oleff Uskar]] agreed to allow [[Asad Al-Nuri]] to visit in the city as long as he kept his armor behind that contained embedded [[Dragon Amber]] as well as agree to be accompanied by an escort of the [[Everwatchers]] choosing and wear the humble robes of an initiate. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] agreed to the terms, even turning over the ownership of his armor to the judge and was then accompanied out of the [[Hall of Justice]] by [[Damien]], a white-robed young man with dark hair and dark beard. As they walked to ultimately meet with the rest of the party, they briefly discussed the differences in their religious views and particularly the differences between [[Horus]] and [[Helm]], especially regarding magic use. They eventually made it to [[The Moonstone Mask]], found their home purchased by [[Gerard Vos]] and slept.

Meanwhile, [[Rushnaa]] attempted to comfort [[Teymir]] regarding the loss of many of his traveling companions over this past year or so since all the events began. She also asked [[Teymir]] to consider if he's willing to possibly lose more in this path he's walking before he reaches the end.

Downstairs, [[Gerard Vos]] caught up with his old bartender friend and former associated [[Eryn]] while waiting for [[Brandt]] to arrive. She told [[Gerard Vos]] he knows she is good at acquiring information and was willing to help however she could to get him out of whatever trouble he's in. [[Brandt]] soon arrived with [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]]. [[Gerard Vos]] begrudgingly purchased them both a room while [[Brandt]] sat and had several drinks with [[Gerard Vos]] and discussed what's next. [[Brandt]] shared that it was the secret research facilities near [[Luskan]] where the employees rioted and burned the facilities to the ground. He warned [[Gerard Vos]] what would happen in the [[Everwatchers]], or worse the [[Thayans]] recovered any of the more illicit tech in the underground facilities near that area. [[Gerard Vos]] recommended finding out who from the [[Everwatch Knights]] would be leading the investigation so they could see if there were some leverage there. [[Brandt]] said that he would stay behind continuing working with the knights to see if he could get more information that way. He told [[Gerard Vos]] he would come by the next morning and see how things were.

The next day, [[Teymir]], [[Elleanna Corvus]], and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] conversed in room 205 regarding [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s relationship moving forward. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] didn't seem to really express any remorse or understanding of such an emotion when asked by [[Elleanna Corvus]] why he tried to kill her. He simply replied that's what seemed necessary at the time. [[Elleanna Corvus]] emphasized to [[Teymir]] multiple times to keep [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] distant from her and that she would consider his choice to come within 5ft of her as an act of aggression. 

You began to converse regarding what your plans would be for the day as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] mentioned wanting to go to some libraries to do some research and others wanted to possibly do some shopping. 

The day is yours.

And that's where we pick up...

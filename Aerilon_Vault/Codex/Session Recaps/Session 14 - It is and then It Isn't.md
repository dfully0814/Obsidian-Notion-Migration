# Last we left off...
The party picked up on their plan for disguising [[Leowin Moonflower]] to hide her true identity from [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] as the party prepared to venture underground to the mysterious temple that Captain Ainsley had alluded to. As most of the party ventured back to the ship to disguise Leowin, [[Tanavast Adamantus]] conversed with her regarding her powers, asking her if she was in control of them or not. In response, a deep bestial-like voice spoke to him and asked, "Are you in control of your's?". Suddenly taken aback by this outburst, Tanavast stepped back slowly and noticed that Leowin quickly returned to herself again, having no recollection of the outburst.

She told Tanavast how the [[Shadovar]] man had told her he meant to "protect others" through her interment on [[Laerkond]]. She told him she didn't know who he was or what he wanted with her exactly, but she is able to sense the same power around Tanavast that she senses in the temple the man took her to. Tanavast and [[Teymir]] then had a heated discussion regarding what to think or how to feel about Leowin and the seemingly increased instability and danger she poses to herself and others. Tanavast continued to express a devotion to Leowin incongruent with how long he's known her, even expressing he alone would take her to an island isolated from the world and stay with her there if it would protect her from herself and everyone else.

[[Azure Flint]] then visited Leowin in the cargo hold, discussing with her the feeling she has of having no control over what's been happening to her like a "fish carried along by the ocean." He told her that it's when you try to swim against the ocean that you feel helpless; you should swim with it instead and just play the hand you're dealt. He told her a story about a large sea creature that "sometimes is and sometimes isn't." He mentioned that it indiscriminately kills and consumes. He proceeded to give her a ring with a jellyfish figurine inserted into it with a sharp edge at the bottom soaked with jellyfish poison, telling her that she's not in control. [[John Smith]] meticulously disguised Leowin as an orphaned deckhand while Teymir assisted by providing drab clothing for her to wear instead of her jade green dress. Reluctantly, Leowin put on the clothing and the party made their way back to the jungle campsite.

Seeing Leowin somewhat wary of walking through the overgrown jungled bed, Tanavast hoisted her onto his shoulders, witnessing a more entitled and dainty side of her that the party had not yet seen. Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] conversed with Captain Ainsley, discussing the mysterious technology he had constructed and sharing some with the Captain about his interest in "life beyond the now." The Captain shared a vial of the translucent green liquid with Yang, the same as the bubbling liquid within the spherical shapes on his gun, telling him that desire for knowledge brings wisdom and devastation, then telling him "Let's see which it brings to you."

The party proceeded into the large hole leading to the first few rooms of the underground temple where they saw several dioramas depicting various aspects of the life and mythology of what seems to be an ancient race. The party ventured into a muddy octagonal room where they saw a large boulder and a crustacean-like figure moving around slowly near a large boulder. And that's where we pick upâ€¦

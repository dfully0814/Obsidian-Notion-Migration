#recap 
# Last we left off...
You continued speeding through the frigid and blinding snow in the direction of the small hamlet of [[Good Mead]] in search of supplies for the longer journey across the frozen tundra of the [[Uncharted North]] to meet with [[Jarl Storvald]] in his fortress of [[Svardborg]] to attempt to form a temporary alliance with him. [[Galladon]] previously informed you that the Jarl and his tribe had lately been affected by the [[Darkweave]] in some way like your brother [[Elrond Miscavige]], and he told you that you might be able to leverage your common difficulty to seek the Jarl's aid in both helping you reach the [[Reghed Glacier]] where the largest ruined [[Netherese]] city has been discovered under the glacier. You seek this city because Galladon told you it was likely your best chance to better understand what is now happening with Elrond Miscavige and how you might find a cure.

You arrived at Good Mead where you soon saw the remains of what appeared to be another [[Gnoll]] attack on the hamlet. You saw the bodies of men, women, and children, as well as the bodies of the bestial creatures scattered all throughout the village. The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] fired several small missiles from his gauntlets into the air to light the pitch black area around you as you have been traveling in the unexplained perpetual darkness of the north these past several hours.

In addition to the slew of bodies revealed by Professor Klaren Ray's flairs, you saw in the distance a large building built like a large mead hall built onto a 20ft tall hill with two flights of stone steps leading up to the entrance. You saw various detailed dragon head statues affixed to the roof of the building as well as two fully detailed dragon statues flanking the landing of the first flight of stone steps leading to the large hall, which the Professor noticed the more he investigated appeared to look and feel more like a temple than a typical tavern or mead hall.

The left full figured statue was a large dragon with wings unfurled, coiled around a vibrant tree and the dragon was looking regally outward in the distance. The bronze plate at the base of the statue was engraved Draconic, which the Professor could read. The plate was titled "[[Auril]], Mother of Creation." The following poem was written under the title.

> We bow to She who wears the crown; Let the world shiver with dread. Clad in winter's whitest gown, Her snow enshrouds the dead. Her fury sheds but frozen tears as gray clouds issue forth Her wind across the wasteland shears bringing blizzards from the north. All the world in winter's white, sheathed in sleet and ice. Set upon never-ending night, She conjures paradise. Behold her everlasting rime, see how it covers all. Weep not for those she traps in time behind Her glacial wall. Sovereign of summer's lost, General of winter's war; Long live the One of cold and frost. May She reign forevermore.

The second statue was perched upon what appeared to be some kind of broken and porous mountain crags. It also had both large wings unfurled and is looking down with a ferocious look on its face as though it as just landed. At the base of the statue was another bronze plate that read, "[[Arharzel]], the Nightmare in Ivory" with the following poem:

> In our childhood rumors ran Of a world beyond our door Terrors to the life of man That the highroad held in store. He has no darting tongue Teeth saw-edged, nor rattling scales No fire issues from his lungs, No black poison from his tail. He is a create of dark air, Unsubstantial tossing forms, Thunderclaps of man's despair In mid-whirl of mental storms. And there's a true and only fiend Worse than prophets prophesy, Whose full powers to hurt are screened Lest the race of man should die.

The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] then investigated several of the bodies lying around the entrance to the large hall. He found a mixture of [[Good Mead]] villagers, [[Gnolls]] and a small number of figures robed in blue tunics overlaying strange armor that looked to be formed from a mixture of hard leathers and metal with a metal sash draped over the chest engraved with glowing Draconic symbols. The armor also included metallic gauntlets and shin guards each with orange light emanating through interlocking sections. He picked up the body of one of the individuals he found which had dark skin, dreadlocks, and a tattoo design running along the shoulder blades and forming into a diamond shape on the back of the neck.

The Professor then returned and entered the front doors of the hall and peaked into the first open room he came across where he saw evidence of a chaotic and violent skirmish in a large dinner hall where he also saw a large stone hearth with a fire burning in it. He was quickly taken aback and worried at the sight of the burning hearth when the door at the end of the hallway violently swung open and a large 10ft tall Gnoll creature walked through exuding a mixture of almost human moans of pain and feral growls. The creature was carrying a strong reinforced chest. As it entered the hallway, it caught the Professor's scent as he stood there invisible, and the creature charged forward as the Professor quickly flew off back to the sled where the rest of the party was waiting.

Meanwhile, [[Galladon]] caught up with the rest of the group at the sled and you formed a plan to get some of the supplies out of the mead hall as you watched the large Gnoll creature which the Professor had seen begin to walk out into the center of the village and begin to let out a loud moan that began to call forward smaller gnoll creatures out of a series of holes in the ground. Hiraeth managed to raise a few corpses from the dead and send them forward to distract the large group of gnolls which had now congregated in the village center. The rest of the group climbed into the sled and slowly and silently made your way around the perimeter of the village to the side of the hall where two larges holes had been broken open in the side of the walls of the hall.

The Professor flew up and into one of the holes where Hiraeth's demon had previously discovered was a room of supplies. He grabbed as many chests and bags of grain as he could and loaded them onto the sled, and you all then quickly sped away as you began to see the gnolls return from shredding the decoy corpses [[Hiraeth]] had sent.

As you sped away in the sled, you all felt a vibration coming from the stack of chests in the back of the sled. The Professor reached back and retrieved a small almost weightless chest from the stack, seeming to already know which chest the vibration was coming from. He managed to pick a heavy lock on the chest, opened it, and you all saw a pearl-white dragon mask sitting at the bottom. The mask had silvered runes embossed from the forehead down the cheeks of the mask, which the Professor recognized to be Giant runes.

And that's where we pick up...

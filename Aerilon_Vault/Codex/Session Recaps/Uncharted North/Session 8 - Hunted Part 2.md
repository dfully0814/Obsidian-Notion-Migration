#recap 
# Last we left off...
You all awoke to another dark and blistering cold day in the frozen wastes of the [[Uncharted North]]. As [[Elrond Miscavige]] awoke, he noticed that gripped in his hand was a simple bronze pocket watch his father gave him a long time ago, which left him in a state of silent reverie for several moments while [[Aristademus Grahlund]] began to try and ask him what he was looking at with not much success. Demus also mentioned that [[Galladon]] had left to explore the perimeter around the camp to make sure you were not continuing to be followed by any of the hybrid [[Draconic]] creatures.

Meanwhile, the [[Professor Klaren Ray]] walked out of the camp tent to find Thryn tending to the wolves tied to the sled. [[Thryn]] shared with the Professor that he didn't trust him and that the weapons of the metal world like what he adorned himself in were the reason why Taiowa has sent what he referred to as "The [[Corruption]]" to judge mankind for his hubris.

The Professor shared with Thryn that he has to wear his armor in order to survive. Though still not approving, Thryn seemed to understand the concept of survival and shared that fighting for survival is the reason why his people, who he referred to as the [[Ruith]], also employ some of the technology of "the metal world that came before" to survive being hunted by "the machines." He also shared that fighting for his son's survival was the reason why he and a hand full of his people were exiled several years ago.

He then began to share a story about a group he referred to as the [[Wyrmspeakers]] who he believes has been responsible for the sudden and seemingly random disappearance of people from Ruith villages around the [[Reghed Glacier]]. He shared that one day his son disappeared and was gone for weeks. Unlike all the missing Ruith up to that point, his son somehow found his way back to the central Ruith village of [[Taiowa's Watch]]. However, he wasn't fully his son any longer. His skin was blue and scaly and not in his right mind. Believing him to be cursed with Corruption, the Ruith [[High Matriarchs]] ordered him to be executed. In the process of trying to save his son from this fate, Thryn killed a Ruith brave and was exiled, which is a fate worse than death in the wastes.

The Professor shared some of the details of his vision where he saw a humanoid individual being experimented upon and having [[Chardalyn]] somehow dissolved into his body, exhibiting the same blue-skinned and scaly traits as a result. Thryn shared that he had his son smuggled to "The Cairn", which he shared is the "holy mountain" of [[Taiowa]] where she resides. He meant to seek her aid in somehow helping his son and rejoining him there once it was safe and he could guarantee he wasn't being watched or followed.

Not wanting to put his fellow exiles at risk, he shared that it's been years since that occurred, and he has no idea if his son is still alive or not. He hasn't been back to the Cairn as the machines have begun venturing further and have congregated in greater numbers near the Cairn for unknown reasons. Since then, he and his fellow exiles have been raiding courier parties and thieving for survival. Moved by [[Thryn]]'s story, the Professor promised to help Thryn find his son.

The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] also showed Thryn the body of the dark-skinned individual he found in [[Good Mead]]. Thryn shared that the individual was a Ruith and from the looks of his armor was a member of the [[Seekers]]. He shared that the [[Ruith]] are normally not allowed to venture outside what he referred to as The [[Sacred Lands]] due to the belief that all areas outside this boundary are cursed by Taiowa and filled with The [[Corruption]]. He shared that Seekers, however, are capable braves who the High Matriarchs allow to venture outside the Sacred Lands for an important purpose relevant to the good of the Ruith. Looking down at the armor, Thryn shared that this brave would not want this armor to be wasted and would want it to continue to be used for the good of the Ruith and offered to help the Professor take it off.

Meanwhile, as [[Elrond Miscavige]] stepped outside the camp, he saw a distant pair of green eyes on the horizon staring back at him. Further intrigued as to what is happening to him, he ventured out into the darkness, followed by [[Aristademus Grahlund]] at a distance. As Elrond approached the green eyes and began to see the shadowy form of a horse coalesce out of nothing, Demus watched from a distance as the large hulking form of a quadrupedal robotic creature appeared with a shimmering blue flash and lunged at Elrond, quickly swallowing him whole.

Combat began as the party contended with this creature. [[Thryn]] shouted for you to target the cylindrical take of dark orange energy on the underbelly of the creature before being swallowed whole along with Elrond. The Professor managed to grab onto the underbelly of the creature as it lumbered forward toward the camp and began trying to attack the tank as dark orange energy began to spill out of the tank, damaging him but strangely making his senses more acute. Meanwhile, inside the body of the creature, Elrond and Thryn began attacking glowing dark orange pods that appeared to have large clumps of metal cables running into them like hubs as dark orange energy began to pulse through the remaining cables, appearing to disable the creature in various ways as they destroyed each one.

You managed to defeat the creature after it lumbered into the camp and destroyed a large portion of your supplies.

As Elrond found himself teleported out of the body of the creature and lying in the snow, the shadowy form of a horse appeared and walked over to him. After seeming to connect with the horse in some way mentally and feeling like it understood him in a way he hasn't experienced from any of the rest of you in a long time, the shadowy form dissolved into his pocket watch.

You all began to load your remaining supplies back on the sled, surveying the damage and began to discuss what to do next.

And that's where we pick up...

#recap 
# Last we left off...
As you began, [[Elrond Miscavige]] awoke from a vivid and harrowing dream or vision of a writhing and living city floating amidst an ocean of screams and whispers. As he woke, you all noticed him wearing the prominent [[House Grahlund]] family ring, which he seemed to be startled to be wearing. He shared his vision with you and seemed much more angered than normal when [[Aristademus Grahlund]] joked with him by calling him "Miss". He also noticed the dim light around him to be much more glaring and oppressive than normal.

As you all conversed in order to decide what to do next, [[Galladon]] shared with you that you would likely need help in both getting to the city and possibly also navigating it with your lives intact. He recommended that you all travel to see [[Jarl Storvald]], the leader of a remnant band of giants in the [[Uncharted North]]. He mentioned that the Jarl and his tribe have recently also faced deadly circumstances due to the [[Darkweave]], and you might be able to establish a temporary alliance with both of you having common interests at this moment.

You then packed your things and found Jara Stomir's dog sled still tied up and ready for travel in front of the leftover debris of the [[Fishouse]]. [[Galladon]] told you that he needed to tie up a few loose ends here with [[Edgra Durmoot]] and would meet you in [[Good Mead]].

You then set out on the dog sled at the blinding blizzard and darkness when you were suddenly attacked by a pack of wolves, which periodically jumped into the sled and breathed frigid cold and ice. You managed to eventually fight them back as Murlough fought to keep the sled straight and true in the blinding wind and frost pummeling your bodies and the sled itself.

And that's where we pick up....

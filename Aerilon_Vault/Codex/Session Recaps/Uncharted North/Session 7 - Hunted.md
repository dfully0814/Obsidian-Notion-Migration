#recap 
# Last we left off...
After being ambushed by an unknown group of primitive tribes-people, an elderly figure who initiated the attack and later introduced himself a [[Thryn]] stole your sled and began speeding back in the direction you had come. [[Professor Klaren Ray]] managed to fly and catch up with the sled stolen by Thryn and the two began vying for the sled's control and were soon joined by [[Murlough Grahlund]]. You watched as Thryn's eyes glowed a dull red color at times, and he also would cut various areas around his shoulders with his battle-ax, lighting the ax head with dark green flame and cutting through the blasting winds with precision.

As the three fought for control of the sled, Thryn soon saw the Professor's [[White Dragon Mask]] prompting him to should violent warnings at the Professor that his people would no longer be oppressed by him. He continued his onslaught against Murlough and the Professor as the two began trying to talk him down and communicate there seemed to be a grave misunderstanding. Thryn reached into his thick hide coat and pulled out another spherical metallic device and activated it which exhibited a blinding firelight similar to the device Demus saw a large [[Gnoll]] creature use to blow up the fish house. After being successfully persuaded to hear the two out, Thryn began to deactivate his device just as a lightning bolt cracked from the dark and abyssal sky above directly into the sled, damaging all three individuals.

You soon saw the form of a humanoid creature soaring 70ft in the air as your sled soon slowed to a stop as the Professor had previously wrenched the sled in the opposite direction with the momentum of his jet boots. A silhouetted winged [[Draconic]] creature began assaulting [[Thryn]], [[Murlough Grahlund]], and the Professor as the three worked together to help one another to cover as large basketball or pumpkin-sized hail began projecting from a large and powerful sphere the Draconic creature had begun channeling while hovering in the sky. Soon, [[Elrond Miscavige]] reached the sled using his newly acquired ability to see long distances in the dark and began to aid the three against the creature.

Intense exchanges of lightning, hail, and blasts of freezing cold against necrotic crossbow bolts, radiant blasts, and whirling fists began as a fight ensued with a creature who seemed to bring all of the concentrated dangers of the North to bear in a concentrated malevolence, particularly toward the [[Professor Klaren Ray]]. Dodging a relentless bombardment of deadly hail, The Professor and Murlough soon flew up to melee range with the creature where the final stage of the combat began. The creature blasted cold at the two individuals and attempted to create distance, failing to do so after being stopped by attacks from the two. You eventually managed to kill the creature, leaving you all exhausted and near unconscious.

Meanwhile, [[Aristademus Grahlund]] began to investigate the individuals he had trapped in his force wall. As he approached them, he watched as one of the individuals with black dreadlocks grabbed a pepper box gun lying on the ground and methodically began executing the other individuals who had started begging for their lives at any cost. The individual then knelt down and shot himself.

Demus began to investigate the individuals lying on the ground and noticed the black-haired individual that shot the others, bore dimly glowing tribal tattoos along the shoulders up to the back of the neck which formed at diamond-shaped eye at the nape of the neck. The other individuals seemed to have similar tattoos. However, unlike the others, this individual seemed to also have barely noticeable small black shards lodged in between each of his fingers on both hands.

About 10 minutes passed, and suddenly the motionless figure began to stir and moan in pain on the ground. Demus began to hear the sound of the cracking of bones as the figure began to sprout a series of long tendril-like arms, all of its clothes dissolving like they were being soaked in acid. The creature seemed to also grow in height and began lurch forward toward Demus with a horrifying sound of grief and loss emanating from its maw and began to attempt to hug Demus into its arms. Demus managed to escape the creature and hypnotize it temporarily.

As Demus waited to figure out what to do next, he saw [[Galladon]], winded and wounded, pulling two dead human figures in the thick snow. Galladon collapsed in the snow and whimsically waved at Demus as Demus became communicated what had transpired with the creature 40ft or so from their location. As the two talked, they began to hear the sound of desperate weeping from the patch of trees behind them.

Worried he would give away their location and attract the moaning creature back to them, Galladon sauntered to his location and executed the individual and returned in the individual's form, possessing an intimate knowledge about him, which he soon used to impersonate in front of [[Thryn]]. You learned this person was named Rost and was Thryn's grandson. When Demus conveyed to Thryn that the moaning creature had killed his grandson and his other people, you watched as Thryn transformed into a large familiar Gnoll creature and barrelled toward the moaning creature lying hypnotized on the ground, ripping its head from its shoulders with his large and powerful jaw.

You then began to set up camp after a very long day, when Galladon told you he had spied several scouts around your location as you were ambushed, as well as one more of the blue-skinned Draconic hybrids near your location. He postulated that this location was likely a common ambush spot for this group of tribesmen, and it also seemed like you were being followed by these [[Draconic]] creatures, who strangely seemed to know your exact location.

As you all began to sleep and begin your watches, [[Elrond Miscavige]] began to see a distant black horse standing still at the edge of his vision, looking at him, which Murlough was not able to see.

During their watch, Demus and Galladon began to talk at length for the first time. Galladon shared with Demus that he was ready to leave the frozen hell of the [[Uncharted North]]. He told him that something similar is apparently also happening in the south of the [[Dessarin Valley]] near [[Thornhold]]. He also told Demus about another individual of his whom he said he receives orders from. He shared he was ordered here to the North to gain intel on Speaker [[Edgra Durmoot]] who appeared to have become a pawn in a secret operation to smuggle [[Chardalyn]] across the North for unknown purposes, which Galladon hasn't been able to discover. He also shared with [[Aristademus Grahlund]] that he hasn't seen his mother in years and misses her.

Your rest concluded, and you all awoke to another day as dark, disorienting, and cold as you left it.

And that's where we pick up....

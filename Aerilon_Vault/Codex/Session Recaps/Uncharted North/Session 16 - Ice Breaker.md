#recap 
# Last we left off...
After surviving a harrowing scrape with a tree-like giant creature with putrid green skin and many sinewy and boneless arms, your party took flight once again on your rocs loaned to you by [[Rarder Falco]] in search of the frost giant fortress of [[Svardborg]].

After flying for several more hours, you soon found yourselves flying above what appeared to be the frozen over ice sheath of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]]. [[Elrond Miscavige]] soon saw what appeared to be a ship keeled upward at a 45 degree angle with the bow of the ship lodged into the ice.

You all decided to land and investigate the ship. You found that the ship's name was the [[Anguila]] and it looked to be decades old when looking at the wear and rot of the wood of the ship. However, you noticed that technology of the sails, rudder, etc. seemed to be modern.

As Elrond attempted to enter the captain's quarters of the ship, you suddenly encountered two humanoid creatures whose bodies were a mingling of human flesh and glimmering shards of ice holding their bodies together like muscle sinew.

This second harrowing encounter with these creatures revealed a strange weakness about Elrond as you watched him intensely struggling in fear to fight these creatures and appeared to be mostly ineffective against them.

The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] also fell unconscious as he succumbed to the paralyzing cold that seemed to emanate from their bodies.

Working together, you managed to escape the ship on the rocs and fly away, noting in your minds the location of the ship and the possible supplies and other items that rest within.

After a few more hours of flying, Elrond spotted dim blue lights in the distance as you all began to notice a subtle change in the darkness of the sky as the inky blackness of the sky you have been use to seemed to dissipate, revealing what appeared to be a more normal starless and moonless night sky.

And that's where we pick up...

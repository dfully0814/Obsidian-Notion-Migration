#recap 
# Last we left off...
After leaving [[Bryn Shander]] to search out the small checkpoint of [[Waywood Outpost]], you continued your remaining 4 hour journey in the sled accompanied by [[Thryn]] and [[Galladon]]. The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] and Galladon began to engage in conversation after a few hours. They discussed the nature of the journey you currently find yourselves on and the possible danger of interacting with the [[Frost Giants]].

They discussed what it would look like to make a good first impression on a frost giant and what that might take. They then moved to what is currently happening to Elrond. Galladon asked the Professor what motivates him to continue on this journey. The Professor replied that he has both an intellectual curiosity regarding the malady and care for Elrond that exist at tension with one another, concluding that it would have been impossible to carry on having abandoned [[Elrond Miscavige]] and stayed in safety.

They discussed the nature of love and the Professor shared his view that there's a beauty to it in giving control to someone else and knowing they're doing the same to you, while Galladon concluded it to be dangerous and reckless to hand control of yourself over to someone else and that he hates not being in control.

As they talked, Galladon told the Professor that memories have power and are what make you who you are. That what you've done in the past is all part of your story and that questions of good and bad, right or wrong are irrelevant because it was your story and it happened. He then conjured a green sphere in his hand that played a significant memory of the Professor's like a projector screen inside it.

It was the memory of an assistant of his who was like a brother to him who helped keep the Professor alive in the initial stages of his current health issues. The memory was of the two of them caught in a massive storm one evening and the Professor opted to leave him behind, knowing he wouldn't make it if he tried to save his assistant also.

You then arrived at the [[Waywood Outpost]] checkpoint where you saw an old shack that you explored to find it mostly empty and dark with what appeared to be a body covered up in the middle of the room. You were suddenly attacked from behind by a flying creature with a long tail that seemed to manifest out of the darkness itself as it suddenly wrapped itself around [[Aristademus Grahlund]]'s body and began draining the life from him.

You managed to subdue the creature as a halfling figure came running in the distance shouting at you to run as you began hearing more movement in the dead tree canopy above you. The halfing figure joined you as he carried something in his hand that emitted a blinding sunlight around you that seemed to hold off the shadow creatures above.

He led you to his home, which was a metal trailer built into the side of a large hill with dark orange floating gems providing light on the inside. He told you his name was [[Rarder Falco]] and had moved up to serve at this checkpoint some years ago. He told you his partner who had moved with him had been killed by the shadow creatures.

When you mentioned the frost giants, he told you that he had seen a troop of them pass by through this area but wouldn't dare try and speak to them. When you told him you wished to make audience with them, he was stunned at first and then told you in his deceptively concerned but harsh tone that they'd have to see you kill someone to think you were worth an audience.

He lastly told you that you were free to take some of his young flying creatures he has been training that he called [[Roc]]'s on your journey if you wished to avoid a long trek on the frozen ice of the [[Sea of Moving Ice]] that lay ahead of you.

With a lot to consider and think about as you prepare to make your plans for the journey ahead, you all laid down for the night as you heard the scratching of dozens of shadows creatures moving along the exterior of the metal trailer.

And that's where we pick up...

#recap 
# Last we left off...
Battle continued with a ferocious group of gnoll creatures of various armaments and sizes across the small [[Ironhaven]] village of [[Dougan's Hole]] . [[Elrond Miscavige]] continued fighting for his life against a ravenous gray-haired tusk fanged beast inside of the tunnel previously dug by the beast. The beast soon dragged Elrond deeper into the tunnel and proceeded to bite directly into Elrond's leg, sending not pain but a surge of adrenaline through Elrond's body. Though Elrond could not see the location of the creature due to not being able to see in the dark, he felt the creature then let go of his grip on his leg, sending Elrond in full free fall into the depths of the tunnel. Scrambling and fighting for his life, he managed to dig one of his gauntlets into the side of the tunnel wall, stopping him suddenly and ripping his shoulder from its socket.

After a few moments, [[Professor Klaren Ray]] managed to descend down into the tunnel, carried in the air by his rocket boots, grab Elrond, and fly out of the tunnel. The both of them were then assaulted on all sides by several [[Gnolls]], the larger of which you learned could jump tremendous distances before attacking. After already suffering significant mental and physical damage, Elrond succumbed to his wounds and fell unconscious, barely holding to what was left of his vitality. Seeing the danger he was in, Klaren managed to partially heal his wounds using a syringe stored in his armor and the two rocketed away from the center of the town in the direction of the 20 Stones to meet up with Demus.

Meanwhile, [[Aristademus Grahlund]] watched a new half-Elf [[Drow]] figure, who was once [[Mira Antonov]], begin to contend with the 10ft tall hulking Gnoll creature in the [[Fishouse]], which had previously destroyed half of the fish house using a glowing red orb the size of a golf ball. The two watched as the creature then quickly ran over to the other half of the fish house, took out a second orb, threw it to the ground, and destroyed the other half of the fish house. Demus looked on as the creature lay in a heap of gore and flame on the ground, no longer moving.

Bewildered and confused as to what was happening and why, Demus looked to the half-Elf Drow, who continued to urge him to come and help him stop Speaker [[Edgra Durmoot]]. The Drow then offered his hand to Demus and told him that he could get them out to the 20 Stones, 700-800 feet from their current location, more quickly than running. Demus offered his hand, the Drow took it and then Demus felt a strong gravitational pull in the center of his being as all time and space around him retracted to what felt like the size of the point of a pen followed by a bright flash and concussive blast. Demus then felt the opposite reaction after hearing a second concussion as all time and space seemed to rapidly expand all around him as he found himself next to the Drow about 60 ft from the 20 Stones.

The two then sprinted to the stones where Speaker Durmoot knelt in the middle, hands pressed onto one of the 20 stones which she had moved to the middle. Demus also saw dark orange light emanating from between her fingers which appeared to be channeling the bright red beam rising beyond the dark clouds. As the Speaker saw the two arrive, she started frantically shouting, "YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND. THEY'LL KILL US ALL. THEY'LL KILL US ALL." At this point Demus watched as the Drow figure dragged the Speaker away from the stone and a fight ensued between the two until Demus incapacitated the Speaker with laughter, causing a maniacal cackle to bellow from her lungs. As the Speaker cackled, the Drow pulled her up by her hair and proceeded to wrap his other hand around her jaw, wrenching her head in a semi-circle and letting her body fall limp to the icy ground.

When pressed by Demus again regarding what was happening and who he was, the Drow figure introduced himself as [[Galladon]] as he searched the Speaker's body for high end liquor, which he said was rare here in the North. He then suggested that he use the remaining 3-4 hours that Dougan's Hole had left to continue the pleasantries and question answering with Demus out of the cold in the Speaker's well furnished and warm house.

[[Professor Klaren Ray]] and [[Elrond Miscavige]] soon caught up with the group out at the 20 Stones as the full party prepared to make your way back to the Speaker's house. To circumvent the ongoing Gnoll attack on the village, Galladon offered you his hand once more as you all joined hands with one another and then felt another strong time-space contraction and expansion--soon finding yourself in an ornate study of the Speaker's house as Klaren turned and began vomiting on the carpet, proceeded by Demus slumping into a fine chair near the hearth, skin cold and clammy.

Before you began to converse, [[Galladon]] offered to ward the house to protect it from entering fiends as these Gnolls apparently were. After a few moments, he returned to confirm what Klaren had already observed through the house window a few moments before. All of the Gnolls had suddenly and mysteriously vanished from sight.

As you then began to converse with Galladon as he poured each of you high-priced Scotch from the Speaker's liquor cart near her desk, he began to tell you that he had been stationed in [[Dougan's Hole]] for some time to observe the Speaker. He shared with you that the Speaker, who was snubbed in the past for a Speaker position in the largest Ironhaven city of [[Bryn Shander]], had recently been gaining increasing wealth and influence through the transport of a mysterious artifact known as [[Chardalyn]] , an indestructible metal containing other mysterious and otherworldly properties that appear to slowly transform and drive those mad who stay within proximity of it over a cumulative amount of time. He also shared that the Speaker formerly had contacts in the [[Everwatchers]] empire who would also most certainly be interested in the material in their war with [[Thay]].

He also mentioned that after the Everwatchers got wind from the Speaker regarding the discovered of the Chardalyn , they managed to trace large deposits of it to the [[Reghed Glacier]] in the North where they discovered the ruin of the largest fallen Netherese city ever discovered, which they apparently have discovered was gilded in large part with Chardalyn . He also shared that he had managed to discover that Jara Stomir was a member of an ancient order to traced back to the first recorded Reghed tribes in the north who possess the ability to draw power from their blood, some of whom can use their power to take other forms. It seems Jara was also driven mad by a regular exporting of the Chardalyn for the Speaker; however, [[Galladon]] found it odd that he and others from his order would attack Dougan's Hole now and then disappear suddenly.

Galladon then showed you mathematical and technical sketches from the Speaker's desk, which Klaren noticed appeared to be architectural designs of a weapon of some kind in the form of a dragon-like creature made entirely of Chardalyn . Galladon told you that it was this creature the Speaker has now summoned upon Dougan's Hole , which she likely also intended to use against [[Bryn Shander]] itself for its treachery against her. Galladon also showed you some much more crazed drawings from the Speaker's desk. some of which was simple a black hole frantically drawn into over and over. Galladon was not sure what beyond revenge the Speaker intended for the creature but he shared that she certainly had been lead into or gotten involved in something far beyond her. Klaren then responded to Galladon's descriptions by interjecting as to what concern this group would have with such a city. Galladon responded by looking over to Elrond whose leg had begun begun pulling a thick black liquid on the floor beneath, and who appeared almost unconscious sitting up against a wall of the Speaker's house, bloodstained by Elrond's physical wounds. Galladon looked at Elrond and said, "Because you're going to need to help him."

At this point, Elrond fell unconscious and began to hear the voice, who died in the Demonic assault on [[Phandalin]].

"Welcome....", "Elrond, our warrior. Our champion." Then the sound of thousands of screams in terror overlapping with, "You can save us...come find us..., Don't be sad...Be brave...because you can save us." You then find yourself inside of what appears to be an endlessly long glass tunnel, with pronounced geometric edges, lit on the inside by thousands of blue motes of light bouncing around from ceiling to floor and off the walls--the flickering blue light sporadically reflecting off the glass like firelight. And then more whispers, "Save us, Dreadmaster....Don't look away...You can't overcome fear if you won't look at it...We know you're here. He wants to go back...He's scared...Be brave...Look at the fear...It's not too late to turn around....Oh, he heard us...You can show them....Miscavidge......Dreadmaster....You can show them...You can show them the fear....This is the price you must pay....Once you look at it....It looks back at you." At which point the thousands of motes of light go dark simultaneously leaving in a pitch black glass enclosure as you begin to see stars appear outside the enclosure, beginning with one and layering into billions all around you. As you look through the glass floor you see the dark shape of what appears to be a huge creature, writhing and reaching out for you, but you see what appear to be buildings moving at writhing as though alive, areas looking like streets sectioning off city blocks and the streets appear to be pulsing like veins but no people. "Don't be afraid to look....Don't be afraid to dream.....Welcome....welcome....welcome....."

Elrond then awoke as [[Professor Klaren Ray]] was tending his wounds and noticed that he now clutched in his right hand a treasured [[House Grahlund]] ring given to him by his mother to remind him that he is indeed part of the family in spite of how often he feels ostracized. As Elrond shared what he had seen, Galladon began to tell you that there is not much he knows or understands about what is happening to Elrond but can tell from previous observations that he has been infected with what the people of Aerilon are now referring to as the [[Darkweave]] and that if Elrond has any hope of not being overtaken, that solution likely lies in the ruined [[Netherese]] city below the glacier due to the Netherese empire being the most advanced and powerful in recent memory, particularly in the practice of fringe arcane practices.

As the session closed, Elrond noticed that all the lights in the room had become glaring and oppressive in a way he's not used to.

And that's where we pick up...

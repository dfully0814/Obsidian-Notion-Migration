#recap 
# Last we left off...
You all walked out of the metal trailer in [[Waywood Outpost]] as [[Rarder Falco]] lead you to a number of young [[Rocs]] he had offered to let you borrow for your travels north. Some of you attempted to win the affections of some of the Rocs, and some of you were more successful than others.

You all eventually mounted each of the Rocs, deciding to take a total of four of the creatures. [[Koma]] ([[Murlough Grahlund]]), [[Mara]] ([[Aristademus Grahlund]]/[[Elrond Miscavige]]), [[Hioma]] ([[Galladon]]), [[Hari]] (Professor/[[Thryn]]).

You continued flying on your relevant Rocs in pursuit of [[Svardborg]], the stronghold of a rare frost giant tribe lead by [[Jarl Storvald]]. The darkness, deadly cold wind, and bone-chilling temperatures continued to bear down on you as you flew 120ft above ground, seeing mostly dead trees below you.

After four hours of flight, you decided to stop and take a short rest where you encountered a giant creature 15ft tall with putrid green skin intermingled with bark, causing it to resemble a rotting tree. The creature had a series of boneless arms with hardwood-clawed hands. As you all rested in a clearing in a forest of dead trees, the creature ran out, catching you unaware, and proceed to flail its arms, knocking a number of you prone and gravely wounding some of the Rocs.

Murlough quickly ran to one side of the clearing, poured lantern oil onto one of the trees, and proceeded to light the tree on fire providing some light in the clearing. He then proceeded to lead the Rocs to him away from the giant creature as the rest of the group fought the creature.

You eventually managed to kill the creature as Elrond threw his starred sword all the way through the creature's head from bottom to top before watching the sword quickly fly out of the top of the creature's head and land blade first into the snowy ground.

You then gathered yourselves, Murlough healed the wounds of several people in the group along with the Rocs and you set off into the air again.

And that's where we pick up...

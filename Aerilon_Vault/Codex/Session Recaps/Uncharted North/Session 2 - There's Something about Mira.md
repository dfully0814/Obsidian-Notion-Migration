# Last we left off...
As [[Aristademus Grahlund]] looked upon the hulking, humanoid, bestial form of an almost 10ft creature walking on two legs carrying an oversized sword by its side, the small fishing village of [[Dougan's Hole]] was beset upon by what appeared to be a group of gnoll-like creatures of various sizes and armaments. While Demus began to contend with the hulking creature in the [[Fishouse]] as well as several more smaller creatures that soon also burst through the fish house windows, the rest of your party watched and heard as small gnoll creatures began to burst up from the ground and began attacking the people of Dougan’s Hole. [[Hiraeth]] watched as his halfling friend Bardi was thrown out of one of the larger dwellings owned by one of the few more wealthy families in Dougan's Hole, the Thorvison family. Hiraeth worked together with [[Murlough Grahlund]] to pull Bardi to safety as several gnoll creatures emerged from the dwelling and attacked your party.

In the midst of the attack, a gray haired, tusked beast from below--much different than the gnoll creatures in appearance--crawled up from the ground with a thick and dark liquid oozing from the sides of its mouth. It grabbed [[Elrond Miscavige]]'s leg in its teeth and began to pull Elrond into the hole from which it came. As you fought the other gnoll creatures simultaneously, you all began various attempts to wretch Elrond from the wolf-like creatures grasp, all of which have proved unsuccessful up until now.

Meanwhile in the fish house, Demus saw [[Mira Antonov]], proprietor of the local fish house, emerge from around one of the large storage shelves as she began to fight the hulking creature alongside Demus. Demus managed to stun several of the small gnoll creatures as Mira ducked and jumped through the storage shelves, drawing the hulking creature in her direction. As the hulking creature burst through the first set of storage crates in pursuit of Mira and the contents of the crates spilled onto the ground, the creature's demeanor seemed to oddly change. It then took out a golf-ball sized glowing red and orange orb and threw it to the ground, causing a massive explosion that immolated a full half of the fish house, blowing wood shrapnel, debris, and bodies in all directions. Demus was thrown outside the building as well as several of the Dwarf individuals he had spoken with earlier.

As black smoke began to billow from the wreckage 50ft into the air, Demus saw Mira's small form climb up and over one of the few remaining fish crates, dagger in hand, smiled at him and said "It looks like you're starting to have fun." The two entered the destroyed section of the fish house again where a now partially flaming hulking creature remained and began walking toward the still intact section of the fish house. As Mira and Demus continued to attempt to bring the creature down, the creature slammed into the remaining storage shelves, knocking them over in domino-like fashion and falling to the ground itself. Demus watched and Mira jumped on the creature's back, reached out her hand, and summoned an ornate greatsword with rows of runic glowing symbols engraved up and down the blade. She plunged the sword into the creatures back, speaking in sarcastic, male voice, "Oh, just be a good boy and die," as Mira's halfling form dissolved into the form of a half-elf Drow figure with flowing white hair, tight fitting solid black armor that seemed to shimmer like obsidian with spiked pauldrons. The slowly stood back up as the [[Drow]] figure continued to hold the sword in its back as the Drow figure looked at Demus from over the creatures shoulder and said, "Ummm. Hello, Demus. You should go stop the speaker outside."

As the fight with the gnolls and attempts to rescue [[Elrond Miscavige]] continued outside, [[Professor Klaren Ray]] happened to see Speaker [[Edgra Durmoot]])‌ erupt from one of the smaller dwellings beset upon by one of the smaller gnoll creatures. She seemed to carry something in her hands that glowed with a bright orange light. Powered burst from within her hands and blew back the gnoll creature, throwing it through the wood planks of the dwelling. Klaren watched as the speaker began to float a few feet off the ground out to the perimeter of the town near where he knew the 20 stones to be. Soon everyone outside saw a bright solid red beam shoot high into the air.

And that's where we pick up...

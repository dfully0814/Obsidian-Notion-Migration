#recap 
# Last we left off...
After surviving an encounter with the [[Sawtooth]], you began to gather what remained of your supplies and load them back on the sled as you discussed what to do next. On the horizon beyond the camp, [[Elrond Miscavige]] saw a thin purple ring suddenly appear a few feet above the ground, seemingly beginning to draw the ambient purple light back into it like a black hole.

After seeing a few human-sized purple flashes of light streaking back toward the camp, he soon saw [[Galladon]] frantically running toward the sled and being chased by medium-sized hyena-like constructs with grinding metal combines for where their lower jaws should be. As you all quickly loaded onto the sled along with Galladon and [[Thryn]], the creatures began to shoot streams of liquid fire at you as you fled and they followed, damaging several members of the party before you managed to escape from them through [[Aristademus Grahlund]]'s use of an illusion to make it appear a block of [[Chardalyn]] had fallen from the back of the sled and several attacks from others.

You then fought the bitter cold over a six-hour journey on the sled to the town of [[Bryn Shander]]. You made one stop to briefly rest about halfway into the journey where the Professor and Thryn discussed what lay ahead. Thryn shared that his people have hunted and lived among the machines near the [[Reghed Glacier]] for as long as he knows and as long as the histories of the [[Ruith]] have been written.

He also mentioned that according to Ruith history the machines once served Taiowa but under the influence of The [[Corruption]] the people of the metal world who came before and the machines themselves betrayed [[Taiowa]] and sought her destruction. In return, Taiowa cursed the metal world and the machines. He also mentioned that he has briefly scouted the area around [[Kelvin's Cairn]] before and has seen machines twice as large as the Sawtooth you encountered, and he doesn't know why the machines have begun venturing further out from the Cairn, especially to come near the holy mountain of the Cairn.

You then arrived at [[Bryn Shander]] where you encountered a slew of snow-covered bodies lying outside the town. Once you entered the gate of the city you were greeted by a band of townspeople armed with crossbows and swords who appeared to be acting as a makeshift town watch. They demanded to know the details and purpose of your arrival as you looked around and saw the town in disrepair, the gate itself having been damaged to the point that it fell from its hinges when [[Elrond Miscavige]] opened it.

A female figure in black leathers, half-shaved head, and long black hair on the other side soon appeared from a nearby alleyway with a group of 15 more city watch and demanded to know who was in charge. You decided to put Demus forward. The female figure introduced herself as [[Veilan Gant]] as she escorted Demus away, leaving the rest of you behind to eat and drink leftover scraps of food and drink provided to you by the city watch who exhibited and coldness and cynicism toward your presence in the town.

Veilan and Demus arrived at a pub or gathering place Veilan referred to as The Northlook where they found a table to discuss your presence in the town. As Demus followed the escort to the table, he noticed a figure sitting at a nearby table who appeared to stare at him even after he sat down in an unnerving way. He recognized an elongated diamond-shaped tattoo on the figure's left hand which reminded him of a similar tattoo on one of Thryn's fellow exiles who killed the other individuals trapped in Demus's wall of force before killing himself.

And that's where we pick up...

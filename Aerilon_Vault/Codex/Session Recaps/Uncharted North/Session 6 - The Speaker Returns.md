#recap 
# Last we left off...
As you all sped away from the hamlet of [[Good Mead]] after successfully retrieving much-needed supplies for your long journey to meet with [[Jarl Storvald]], The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] began to investigate the dark-skinned human figure he managed to also retrieve from the entrance of the large mead hall. He began to look over the strange armor the figure was wearing, interested to learn its mechanics and ultimately how to remove it.

As he looked over the armor in more depth, he noticed that the armor was made from an inter-mingling of thick hide with a large wolf's head curling up and over the figure's left shoulder and more technology advanced metal formed into hexagonal shapes that were connected with wiring. He noticed a metallic sphere on one shoulder of the armor that seemed somewhat out of place. After slowly turning the sphere in one direction, he heard a depressurizing sound and the sphere opened like an eye and revealed a dark orange stone resting inside surrounded by what appeared to be mirrors. He soon realized these weren't mirrors but transparent and pure versions of the same kind of stone.

In the same moment, a panel on one of the hexagonal gauntlets of the armor suddenly flew open, releasing several metal caltrops which streaked through the air leaving purple trails behind them and dug into the ground slightly ahead of the sled as [[Elrond Miscavige]] continued piloting forward. You then felt a tremendous gravitational force press in upon you as you all took force damage and the entire sled was lifted 20ft into the air until the Professor and [[Murlough Grahlund]] worked together to slowly push the sled back to the ground. The Professor investigated the area where the caltrops landed and found that they appeared to be virtually invisible as he managed to only recover two of them.

After getting back into the sled and setting off again, the Professor noticed that the same gauntlet had a second opening near the knuckles that appeared to have a shimmering metal arrowhead lodged into a hole in the opening, but he decided not to investigate further.

The Professor then began to look over the [[White Dragon Mask]] and eventually decided to attune to it and put it on. After attuning to it, the rest of the party watched as his body became still, and he went into a catatonic state as the sled continued speeding forward in the dark and frigid cold. The Professor opened his eyes to find himself in a completely different place. He was sitting on a cold stone bench in an all stone cell enclosed by heavy iron bars. The cell was empty other than an inscription he saw on one of the stone walls that appeared to have been scratched into the wall. The inscription was in Common and read, "[[The beginning is ending]]."

As he read the inscription, he began to hear screams of pain and muffled voices echoing down the hallway. As he approached the bars to listen closer, the heavy iron door of the cell slowly creaked open on its own. After turning himself invisible, he made his way down the hallway and saw a series of other cells, which each contained humanoid figures in tattered plain clothing, each with scaly blue skin, oblong reptilian heads, and abnormally long and clawed hands.

The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] eventually came to an open room down the hallway where he found the source of the screams. Inside the room, he saw a series of metal operating tables strewn about the room, each covered in gore. The walls, floor, and ceiling were also covered in blood and skin. He saw three figures standing around one table that appeared to have a humanoid figure laying on it. Two figures were wearing white blood-stained coats with heavy metal gloves on each arm. The third figure was wearing a red robe, with a red dragon mask covering its face. The Professor heard the robed figure shout to the others in [[Draconic]], "Get the process right this time.

You would be foolish to fail Sammaster again." The two figures replied, "Yes, Speaker." The Professor then watched as one of the figures walked over to a metal table which was covered with a large pile of [[Chardalyn]]. The figure used the heavy metallic gloves to pick up a large piece of Chardalyn and bring it over to the figure lying on the table. The white-coated figure then raised the Charalyn piece in the air and rammed it into the chest of the figure on the table. The white-coated figure then grabbed a saw-like device that was very technologically advanced in the Professor's summation and began grinding into the Chardalyn piece in the figures body. As the device ground into the Chardalyn, it began to disappear like it was being dissolved or absorbed. The Professor saw no pieces falling onto the ground.

Suddenly, the Professor felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned to see the figure of one of the blue-skinned Draconic-human hybrids standing in front of him, eyes glowing an angry blue-green and fangs snarling. In a ferocious growl, the figure said to the Professor in Common, "We see you, Speaker and we'll find you." At that point, everything went black and the Professor awoke once again in the sled.

[[Elrond Miscavige]] continued guiding the sled forward, assisted by [[Galladon]] as he tried to remember and guess your location in the dark and froze wastes. Galladon told Elrond to look for a lake to the east as a sign that he had gone too far and missed the crossroads he would look for to find the safest path to turn and continue west. After traveling 30 minutes longer and not seeing the lake, Elrond decided to begin turning around, assuming that he had missed the crossroads.

As Elrond began to turn the sled around, you began to hear a distant cry for help carried along with the blasting and frozen winds. In the distance, Elrond and Galladon began to see a faint light appear and grow ever closer. After realizing it was another sled, Galladon told the rest of you what he'd seen, and [[Murlough Grahlund]] and [[Aristademus Grahlund]] existed the sled and walked out to meet the other oncoming sled.

As the sled pulled up next to Murlough and Demus, an gray-haired male figure with a long dread locked hair, thick unkempt gray beard, and long and heavy white hide coat shouted down saying that his daughter had been attacked by a pack of wolves and was dying in the back of the sled where Murlough saw a group of individuals sitting. Murlough quickly made his way over to the sled and began to climb up into it as the individuals exited to tend to the sled dogs and the elderly individual also exited. Murlough saw a form lying in the sled wrapped in a heavy burlap sack. He pulled the heavy material back to see a bundle of grain. At this point, he heard the sound of a metal object clanging into the sled and a heavy pulse of energy, knocking him unconscious and out of the sled. The Professor and Elrond also saw a series of objects hurled into the sky and landing near the sled, one of which also knocked Elrond unconscious.

Battle ensued as the elderly figure attempted to kill Murlough before the Professor intervened to protect him. Demus managed to capture three of the individuals in a wall of force they were unable to escape. The elderly figure quickly ran off into the trees while the Professor attacked the other figure before he too ran off into the trees out of sight. The Professor then grabbed Murlough, who had recently been slapped awake by Demus and flew back to the sled, which he soon discovered was gone. In the distance, he saw the sled speeding off back the way you came with a single figure steering it. The Professor dropped Murlough and just managed to make it to the sled where he now faces the elderly figure alone.

Murlough gathered himself, got up from the ground and found himself int total darkness with the sound of someone right next to him. Assuming it to be one of the hostile figures, he began a whirling assault of fists and feet on the individual, soon breaking his neck and sending him limp to the ground. Murlough, not knowing the location of the sled or the rest of the party, finds himself in pitch darkness and a whirling blizzard, the only light source anywhere around being the single lantern hanging from the other sled.

And that's where we pick up...

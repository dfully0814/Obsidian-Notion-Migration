#recap 
# Last we left off...
[[Aristademus Grahlund]] began his conversation with [[Veilan Gant]], a black leather-clad female with long combed-over hair and head buzzed on one side. Demus began to share with her the nature of why your group has come to [[Bryn Shander]], a city that you quickly saw was filled with overpopulation, sickness, and poverty. To show [[Veilan Gant]] some of the constructs that have assaulted you out in the wastes, Demus cast a minor illusion on the table. With a sudden and instinctual response, Veilan reached for her sword while Demus simultaneously saw a faint dark orange glow emanate from the whites of her eyes.

Knowing what the possibly meant for him, Demus attempted to deescalate the situation by telling her your group has no interest in getting in the way of the empires dealings up here. Veilan responded by telling Demus she once served as a Sergeant in the [[Everwatch Knights]] but doesn't any longer but didn't give any further detail, which Demus didn't follow up on.

She then told Demus that Bryn Shander has been under attack by frost giants for the past several months, and they have raided the city at seemingly sporadic times. Demus offered his skills and services, telling Veilan that he might be able to broker peace with the frost giants. Seeing that Veilan was skeptical to enlist his aid, Demus walked over and found a tribesman who was taking refuge in the [[Northlook Inn]]. The figure was dressed in full yeti hide with a tall headdress with colorful dangling beads. Demus walked over to him and magically began speaking in a language that he knew the man wouldn't understand. Taken aback by and seemingly honored by the interaction with someone from Ironhaven which he seemed to not be used to, the man asked Demus to sit down. He introduced himself as [[Aratak]], a member of the [[Cahokia]] tribe who lives far beyond the Reghed Glacier.

When Demus asked about his motivation for being in Bryn Shander and his interpretation of what was going on in the North, Aratak told Demus he was in Ironhaven to find help for his people who had fallen sick to [[Taiowa]]'s [[Corruption]]. He described that Taiowa's Blue Light was fading and being lost because of The Corruption and his people have been entrusted to guard the light. As he spoke, Demus noticed that metallic cables were embedded into Aratak's skin emitting a faint blue glow underneath.

[[Aristademus Grahlund]] told Aratak that he hopes there is some way they can help one another in the future and then left the table. Seeing that [[Veilan Gant]] and her escort had already left, Demus looked over to where they sat, seeing that the figure with the diamon tattoo on the hand was also gone and another figure who had been sitting at the table also was lying face first down on the table motionless. Demus quickly checked to see if any blood was pooling under the chair. Not seeing any, he told one of the workers that the person at the table might be dead. As he headed toward the door, he heard a scream as a group of other people ran over to investigate.

Veilan told Demus that she would think on if she wants to enlist his aid overnight and have an answer for him in the morning. Meanwhile, you were told you could sleep in the stables.

You all made your way there and [[Thryn]] brought in the sled dogs as well. On the way, the Professor protected an elderly man from being murdered when [[Elrond Miscavige]] gave him some food and others around him saw it. The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] gave them food as well to deescalate the situation.

While backtracking to the gate to meet up with everyone, Demus saw a cart of bodies being toted out of a nearby alleyway. The cart tipped on a cobblestone and one of the bodies slid half way out onto the stone. As it did, he saw the body had ashen gray skin with small vines growing out of the arms.

Thryn and Demus rode together through the city to the stables where Thryn told Demus some about the [[Cahokia]] people when Demus mentioned having met one. He told Demus that tensions have been very high between the two tribes as [[Taiowa]]'s [[Corruption]] has gotten worse. Thryn mentioned that instead of hunting the machines around the glacier-like the [[Ruith]] do, the [[Cahokia]] try and become them, believing it to be the way to guard the light of Taiowa before it's snuffed out.

Back in the stables, the Professor and [[Murlough Grahlund]] were moved as they heard painful moaning coming from all the stalls on the left of the stable, realizing each stall had someone in it. The Professor and Murlough entered one of the stalls to see if they could help. In the stall, they saw a gaunt malnourished woman huddled in the corner with large ice spikes sticking out of her shoulder and blood trickling down around the wounds. As they tried to communicate with her, they quickly noticed she wasn't lucid and wasn't aware of her surroundings.

Murlough attempted to heal her by sending some of his Ki magic into her body, causing her to suddenly and sharply screech in a mixture of pain and anger. Horrified, Murlough stood up and began to pace as the Professor dragged the woman over near the fire. The Professor cast Dispel Magic on the ice spikes, causing them to dissolve into dust and leaving the open wounds behind. The woman continued in a disembodied moan. The Professor tried again to heal her with the same result. He brought Murlough over and convinced Murlough to send Necrotic energy into her body instead to see if that would help ease her pain.

As Murlough sent the Necrotic energy into her body, the woman's moan turned into a low growl as her skin began to turn a charcoal black and her fingers began to grow long and sharp. As Murlough sat stunned and horrified at what he had done, the Professor picked up the woman, took her out into a nearby alleyway and sent healing into her body until she died.

Some of the group began to lay down to sleep for the night, leaving [[Galladon]], Murlough, and [[Thryn]] awake.

As [[Elrond Miscavige]] drifted off to sleep, all he could hear was the sound of that woman's growling. As the growling got louder and was all around him, he opened his eyes finding that he was in another place. He was standing on a shoreline, ash falling from the sky like snow.

As he looked down the shoreline he saw a long pier extending out into the ocean on one side with small green motes of light bouncing around and into one another at the end of the pier. Down the other end of the shoreline he saw what looked like a large military encampment built at the base of a large mountain range that extended to the north of his location. A dim green hue emanated up and over the mountains from where he stood. He then saw his horse standing at the end of the pier, staring back at him with its flaming green eyes.

Elrond walked down the pier to the end where looked closer at the green motes of light slowly bouncing around. Inside of each mote, he started to see his memories—from when he was a child in [[Phandalin]], memories of his father, when his father gave him the pocket watch, when his mother gave him the [[House Grahlund]] ring, etc. He then saw an image in a larger mote of light that started to slowly drift toward him. The image was a large black sphere with aura emanating out from it—bending and emptying into the dark center like a large black hole. Elrond began to hear whispers all around him, "Champion...Save us champion. Not Miss anymore..." And then he began to hear, "The gate.....you will destroy the gate.....because when you look at it.......it looks back at you.....the gate......gate......gate".

At this point Elrond shot awake in a white flash. Laying next to him was a sword with dark jagged hilt with what looked like claws reaching up to the blade. The blade itself wasn't metal but looked like an endless night sky with twinkling stars. On one side of the blade in that night sky Elrond saw the same dark sphere surrounded by purple light.

The first instinctive emotion Elrond suddenly became aware of in that moment was "hunger".....

And that's where we pick up...

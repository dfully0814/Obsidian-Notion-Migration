You all began to discuss what to do with the shadowy creature that was once a woman sitting still in a stable stall in obedience to [[Elrond Miscavige]]'s command. [[Veilan Gant]] soon entered the stable after being called by the [[Professor Klaren Ray]]'s flair fired into the air. Cautious and taken aback, she began to wonder if your group had something to do with the presence of the creature.

After you managed to convince her that you were not involved, the Professor and Elrond slowly walked over to the creature and managed to affix heavy shackles over its wrists while managing to fight off an oppressive neurotoxin of some kind emanating from the body of the creature.

# Last we left off...
The previous evening in the stables, [[Murlough Grahlund]] stepped into another stall in the [[Bryn Shander]] stables to see a boy lying on the ground motionless and unaware of his presence and breathing heavily with shards of ice protruding from his skin as though shrapnel had blasted across his body. His skin was also a dark shade of gray with small vines growing out of his arms. 

Murlough took a while to carefully remove each shard of ice from the boy's skin, seeing at the end that it didn't seem to affect the boy's state. Murlough then walked over and began to experiment with one of the shards of ice by stabbing it into his thumb, which suddenly knocked him unconscious for the rest of the night. He awoke the next morning seeing that there were small black veins running out from the entry wound on the pad of his thumb.

[[Elrond Miscavige]] awoke to see a new and strange sword beside him. The blade looked like an endless starry sky. As he came to consciousness, he heard a gruff voice speak to him in waves of calm and then frantic tones. The voice referred to him as "champion" and told him that he would do great things, but that he would first need to kill the boy lying sick on the bottom floor of the stables.

Seeing that Elrond was awake, [[Aristademus Grahlund]] walked over and tried to reach out and pick up Elrond's sword. Elrond suddenly jumped back and a mysterious power activated causing him to shimmer in shadow, and a confrontation began as Elrond seemed to begin to think Demus was attacking him.

Seeing this occur, the [[Professor Klaren Ray]] stepped in the middle of the two and managed to talk Elrond down. You then decided that Demus and the Professor would go and meet with [[Veilan Gant]] while [[Murlough Grahlund]] and Elrond would stay behind and try to tend to some of the other sick people in the stables.

Elrond and Murlough opened another stall to see a woman sitting up against the wall whose skin was still normal color but who also had ice shards protruding from her body. Murlough quickly went to work to help the woman by also removing the ice shards from her body while Elrond became distracted by the dead woman in the adjacent stall who had been mercy killed by the Professor the previous evening. As Elrond looked at her lying in the stall, he began to feel intense emotions of hope and power.

Murlough managed to eventually wake the woman to find out that her injuries were the result of a frost giant attack almost a week ago. Murlough began to feel that blood or some substance was pooling up in the woman's arms. He made a small incision on her forearm to see black liquid spill forth from her arm and began tying a tourniquet around her shoulder to see if he could stop the spread of the substance to the rest of her body.

Meanwhile, Demus and the Professor met with Veilan and some of her fellow former Everwatch Knights. Demus offered to travel to meet with [[Jarl Storvald]] and see if peace or a truce could be brokered. The other knights laughed at the absurdity of what he proposed while Veilan more soberly cautioned him that it's unlikely the [[Frost Giants]] will understand anything but violence and displays of strength.

She told Demus that the most recent attack occurred about a week ago and both Veilan and Speaker [[Duvessa Shane]] tried to negotiate to no avail. Veilan is still not sure why they are being attacked. She also told you that before, a Frost Giant hasn't been seen in the [[Uncharted North]] in decades. However, she agreed to enlist your help and told you that she would be scraping up some supplies for your journey and would meet you at the stables in the next few hours.

And that's where we pick up...

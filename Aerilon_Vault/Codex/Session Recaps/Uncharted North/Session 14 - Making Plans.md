# Last we left off...
After escaping a host of shadowy creatures bearing down on you in the small checkpoint of [[Waywood Outpost]], a halfling named [[Rarder Falco]] lead you into his snowy hillside trailer where you began your preparations to travel to the [[Frost Giants]] fortress of [[Svardborg]] to meet with [[Jarl Storvald]] in order to seek his aid.

[[Professor Klaren Ray]] questioned [[Rarder Falco]] about the orange gems floating in the trailer, which he seemed cautious to answer. As the rest of the party began to lay on the cold metal floor to sleep, Rarder asked the Professor to step outside for a chat.

Once outside and while holding up a glowing sphere as bright as the sun, Rarder began to share a series of new details with the Professor.

He shared that the Red-masked figure that the Professor saw in his vision was with the group of Frost Giants that previously passed through this area.

Rarder also revealed himself to be a member of the [[Harpers]] and shared that the reason he is living in this small checkpoint is because he is on assignment to perform recon and surveillance on the machinations of the [[Wyrmspeakers]].

The Professor shared with Rarder about the blue-skinned [[Draconic]] humans that you have seen and how he saw those in his visions as well. Rarder shared that he had not seen any creatures like this and also didn't seem familiar with [[Chardalyn]].

However, after the Professor shared more details with him about [[Good Mead]], the temple there, and the white dragon mask found there, he began to postulate that the Wyrmspeakers may be using this Chardalyn to build a Draconic human army they can control or even have a larger game in mind to test the ability of Chardalyn to weaken the mind of something with Dragon blood for the purpose of possibly controlling an actual dragon, which he dismissed fairly quickly not believing Dragons to be real but only existing in the mythology around the [[Calamity]] as weapons created by the [[Prime Deities]] to fight the [[Betrayer Gods]].

He also reminded the Professor that the Wyrmspeakers were a fanatical cult that arose during the reign of the Netherese empire in Thay and were bent on seeing dragons reign over all of [[Toril]] and beyond, believing them not to be constructs of the Prime Deities but the Prime Deities themselves.

He and the Professor began to realize that the fortress in the Professor's vision seemed a lot like a nearby mountain fortress known as the [[Doomspire]], which Rarder shared is believed to have once been the dwelling of a full-blood clan of Blue Dragons known as the [[Blood of Moureme]].

Rarder also began to ask the professor if the Draconic human creatures seemed to be under control by anything or if they seemed hostile to him because of his mask, implying a potential hostility toward the Wyrmspeakers and not the [[Professor Klaren Ray]]. The answer remained unclear.

Rarder also shared with the Professor that his purpose in [[Waywood Outpost]] was two-foldâ€”to recon the [[Wyrmspeakers]] and protect the Dragon Amber stones which he said he acquired from a contact in the [[Dessarin Valley]].

The next morning, the [[Professor Klaren Ray]] shared the details of the conversation as you all began to make plans for what lies ahead. Some believed the Red-masked figure might be controlling the giants so a debate began about whether to try and parley with the Red-masked figure, the giants, or take a more physical approach to capture the red-masked figure.

We begin as you all stand in the trailer to finalize your plan if you choose to do so.

And that's where we pick up...

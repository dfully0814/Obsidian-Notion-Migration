#recap 
# Last we left off...
Flying on your [[rocs]], you made your way to the ice island fortress of [[Svardborg]] to meet with [[Jarl Storvald]] and seek his aid. [[Elrond Miscavige]] lead your group of rocs closer to the fortress and noticed the fortress was surrounded by water and 50ft ice walls all the way around. The fortress was illuminated by floating blue spheres all around providing light across the fortress.

As you descended closer, you were spotted by a giant patrolling the top of the wall. Immediately, he shouted that a Netherese was approaching. You weren't sure based on the sound of his voice if it was a warning or not.

The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] and [[Aristademus Grahlund]] decided to fly closer to converse with the giant as another giant began to close in from the opposite side of the wall. The Professor began to shout at the giant insistently his demand to see [[Jarl Storvald]], which seemed to eventually win the giant over. Sharing with the giant that Demus was your leader, the giant demanded only Demus would be allowed to enter.

The two giants lead Demus into the heart of Svardborg where Demus saw 250ft long ships docked in a central watery grotto of the fortress, a large 50 iron ship gate, and several 40ft tall wooden buildings half covered in ice and snow. The giants lead him into one of the largest structures, where Demus saw rows of tables filling the room, a large mammoth raised on a spit in the middle of the room, and formless and whispy frost creatures with wings looking on from above on the rafters looking over the room.

The giants lead Demus to the back of the room and up the stairs through a heavy hide curtain into a 300ft long icy room where Jarl Storvald sat across the other side on a jagged and icy throne. The Jarl slumped over somewhat limp in the chair with putrid green skin and puss oozing from the exposed parts of his skin. He was wearing heavy plate armor whose color was muted like it was smeared with charcoal.

As he and [[Aristademus Grahlund]] began to speak, Demus seemed to notice he was laboring to show his supremacy and dominance. Demus remembered [[Thrym]] is the giant god many frost giants worship, who is usually depicted as a perfect version of a regular frost giant, which informed Demus as to how the frost giants tend to view themselves. Demus called out the Jarl's apparent affliction and offered his assistance, to which the Jarl responded, "How is such a tiny thing going to help me?" [[Jarl Storvald]] then asked one of the giant escorts if there were any more of Demus' group. Finding out there was more, he insisted they all be brought forward.

After a while, the entire party was escorted into the Jarl's throne room when the Jarl almost immediately became intrigued by Elrond. The Jarl's composed demeanor quickly seemed to shift as he began to say he sensed something in [[Elrond Miscavige]] and began to demand to have it. Instinctively, Elrond's starry sword flashed, causing Elrond's body to begin to shift and sway at unnatural speed. Also reacting instinctively, Demus managed to dispel the effect Elrond's body. Elrond then mounted his shadowy horse which had seconds before spilled out of his pocket watch, and he began charging toward the Jarl.

The Jarl responded by shouting treatery, rose from his icy throne and began to attack Elrond along with another well-armored frost giant in the room, along with the Jarl's wolves that appeared to be made of solid ice.

After several devastating blows from the Jarl and his counterpart, Elrond fell limp to the ground unconscious.

The [[Professor Klaren Ray]] and [[Murlough Grahlund]] remain 40ft off the ground, 20ft from the Jarl, and Demus stands back 30ft from the Jarl's throne as Murlough prepares to act.

And that's where we pick up...

#recap 
# Last we left off...
You started your first morning in the city of [[Neverwinter]] as you all got ready for the morning and made your way downstairs. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] introduced [[Damien]] to [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] after they ordered breakfast. When [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] shook [[Damien]]'s hand, [[Damien]] suddenly became very lethargic and fell out of his chair and was headed to the ground before being caught by [[Asad Al-Nuri]]. [[Damien]] seemed to be unable to remember the last few seconds before that as he introduced himself to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] again. Not thinking much of it after making sure [[Damien]] was okay, the group continued their breakfast.

[[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] soon came down and made their way over to the bartender where [[Elleanna Corvus]] attempted to persuade her way to information regarding illegal activities in the city and was promptly shut down by the bartender when the bartender refused to even give his name at that point. However, he did point you to a few merchants in the city where you could find some useful items, some more high priced than others.

[[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] then made their way to [[Wither's Mystical Tinctures]] where they met an older gentlemen named [[Symas Wither]] who appeared to sell different kinds of health tonics and other potions locked ahead securely behind glass cases. They also saw a solider of the [[Everwatch Knights]] patrolling inside the store. [[Symas Wither]] explained that due to recent events near [[Phandalin]] and across the [[Dessarin Valley]], security is much tighter in the city than normal. After browsing the collection, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to make some offers for some of the potions. The two left some items for [[Symas Wither]] to inspect for possible trade-ins and decided they would come back in a few hours once he had time to determine their worth.

Meanwhile, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]] made their way to the [[Hall of Knowledge]] where they reverently entered the large hall by kneeling and ritually dripping water onto their heads from a series of 10 bowls as they entered. [[Damien]] told [[Asad Al-Nuri]] the ritual was symbolic of opening up and cleansing one's mind to receive new knowledge unhindered. After they entered, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] began to research the origin of [[Helm]] and the [[Everwatchers]]. He learned that [[Helm]] appeared to have at least been based on a real historical person who never gave themselves to the allure of magical power during the [[Age of Arcanum]] when the [[Netherese]] sought to rise to the level of the gods in their arcane study. He learned the [[Netherese]] believed there was nothing special about the gods themselves but that the gods were only regular people who had mastered the arcane. He learned that after the devastation of the [[Calamity]] when the gods locked themselves away, it was [[Helm]] who was chosen by them to stand at the "door" of the [[Divine Gate]] to ensure that nothing would ever again enter or exit. [[Helm]] was chosen because of his steadfastness during the events leading to the [[Calamity]] which left very few untarnished by [[Tharizdun]]'s influence.

He learned some regarding the nature of arcane practice itself. It seems that it was believed that arcane power actually attracted [[Tharizdun]]'s influence somehow and it was through the repeated use of powerful magical effects that resulted in the manifestation of its influence again after the [[Sirin]] had been unsuccessful in sundering it into oblivion.

He then saw regular mention of a man named [[Vespin Chloras]], who was a charismatic and lone voice that began to speak out against magical use when the events of [[Karsus' Folly]] resulted in the devastation of the [[Netherese]] and every great city of [[Aerilon]]. He began to gather a following who called themselves the [[Ezrella]], who vowed to never again allow events like [[Karsus' Folly]] to occur, no matter what the cost. This fringe group eventually began to grow its influence and power and began to conduct raids upon magic adepts and anyone exhibiting magical abilities. A conquest of sorts began that even resulted in many historical texts being destroyed that revealed arcane knowledge. It was this group who eventually became the [[Everwatchers]] who began to observe [[Helm]] as their patron saint--not worshiped as a god but respected and venerated as the one who they should all aspire to be to remain the protectors of [[Aerilon]].

The day continues on as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]] remain in the [[Hall of Knowledge]], [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] remain out in the city, and [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] sit at a table in [[The Moonstone Mask]].

And that's where we pick up...

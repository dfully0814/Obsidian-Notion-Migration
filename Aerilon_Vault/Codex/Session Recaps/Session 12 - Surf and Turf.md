# Last we left off...
Your skeleton crew of the [[Anguila]] began finalizing the details of a plan to find a way into [[Waterdeep]]. The party agreed on a plan to first find a caravan or group of people they could use to send a message to some of their contacts in Waterdeep and also potentially acquire some [[Everwatch Knights]] armor. While still aboard the ship making their final plans, [[Teymir]] and [[Azure Flint]] had their first opportunity to discuss the events of the past 5 days.

Teymir, haunted by many questions regarding how the [[Drow]] woman knew his name, if the [[Valkurians]] can be trusted, and what it all means in learning who he is. Teymir also came to grips with what he had done while under the control of the Drow woman, telling Azure Flint he never wants to feel like that again. Azure asked Teymir what he hoped to gain by learning about his past. Teymir responded by saying that a person's past makes them who they are, and up to this point he doesn't really know who he is. He uses Azure as an example of a man seemingly built up by a host of varied and unique life experiences. Teymir concluded that he has chosen to throw in his lot with [[Leowin Moonflower]] because he believes she is somehow a key to learning more about his past.

As the party found their way to their beds for the night, [[Tanavast Adamantus]] was awoken early into the morning by a terrifying dream--one that contained the beautiful and harmonic sound of many voices singing in chorus and then through it the sound of loud screams and tremendous heat. As he made his way up onto the main deck of the ship, he again released whatever ability he seems to have to provide sense-enhancing abilities to everyone near him. As he walked closer to [[Leowin Moonflower]] and Teymir, who were talking to one another near the front of the ship, Leowin, sensing what was coming from Tanavast, jumped up into a defensive stance, causing the now falling rain to begin swirling around her legs. Tanavast began telling her he didn't mean any harm and was trying to help.

The confrontation soon deescalated and Tanavast and Leowin discussed what had transpired. She began by asking Tanavast, "What have you done?" She went on to tell him that she felt something in the power of his ability she hadn't felt in a long time, since she was taken to the temple on [[Laerkond]]. She told Tanavast she believes the [[Shadovar]]'s power and what he is using is somehow connected. Tanavast and Teymir also had a discussion on the ship where Tanavast told Teymir about his tremendous concern about the danger of the misuse or abuse of magic and the harm he has seen it cause. He told Teymir that if it ever comes down to protecting the innocent or loyalty to Teymir he's going to protect the innocent, even if he has to protect them from Teymir.

When Teymir told Tanavast that it seems they may have found themselves on the "wrong" side of whatever is going on, Tanavast replied by saying, "There is no right or wrong side." As the party approached the shoreline where they had determined to beach the ship, Azure saw a group o 11 men, one dressed in sleeveless black attire offsetting him from the others, who were dressed more like the ruffian seafaring folk Azure is used to being around.

As the ship began a ramming course onto the beach, the crew watched as the men ran up and over an embankment on the beach, taking cover behind it and some of whom began shooting dark orange beams of light from what Azure saw through his clairvoyance spell to be coming from a metal gun with a blue swirling orb inset into the grip.

Charging the beach, Tanavast deflected several beams and began holding off 8 attackers who charged over the embankment over time. While engaged with Tanavast in battle, Azure summoned shadowy tentacles that killed 7 of the men, sending the bigger man and the final two running off into a large forest behind them. The session concluded as Tanavast and Teymir gave chase into the forest trailing the 3 men while Azure, [[Yang Tieh]], [[John Smith]], and Leowin. The larger man has just bowled over Teymir as Teymir has dashed up behind him and then teleported in front of him and Tanavast is 90 ft. behind.

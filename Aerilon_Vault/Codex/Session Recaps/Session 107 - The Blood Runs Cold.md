#recap 
# Last we left off...

Your party continued fighting for your lives alongside multiple contingents of [[Everwatch Knights]] and their commanders as all across the snowy battlefield you rushed to one another's aid. In multiple quadrants you watched as some of the Knight Commanders felled giants while [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] also defeated one of the magical female giants that had attacked them.

Meanwhile, as [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] stared down the [[Thayan]] female who had jumped from the trees and had fired streaks of lightning energy at them, she waved her hand and opened a large hole in the ground from which came a dark necrotic energy carrying with it spectral creatures that hovered around the hole and began to attack [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]]. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] responded by summoning his celestial companion to fight alongside them. The two then heard the voice of the [[Thayan]] female in their heads say in a raspy and insistent voice, "Don't follow me." At that point she took to the air and flew toward the back of the train an incredible speed.

In his quadrant, [[Gerard Vos]] watched as a unit of [[Everwatch Knights]] were suddenly routed by an increasingly violent group of Shadowghasts, leaving him, [[Professor Klaren Ray]] and one of the knight commanders to face off against the Shadowghasts and a frost giant. The commander quickly turned to head off the Shadowghasts as they closed in as [[Gerard Vos]] began to fire shots to the giant, significantly damaging the giant, sending it into a violence-fueled rage. [[Gerard Vos]] then quickly made for the forest of dead trees in the distance as the giant gave chase, eventually catching up with [[Gerard Vos]] in the woods and landing a series of devastating blows with its axe, knocking [[Gerard Vos]] unconscious. 

Seeing that he was in danger, [[Teymir]] quickly jumped from the trees to the south and supernaturally sped to [[Gerard Vos]]'s location, making it just in time to watch the final light of life leave [[Gerard Vos]]'s eyes as the blood thirsty frost giant stood towering above the two ready to strike again.

And that's where we pick up....

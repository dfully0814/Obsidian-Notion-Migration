# Last we left off...
As [[Yang Tieh]] held a dagger to the throat of an older [[Drow]] male figure in a laboratory-like room filled with tanks of human bodies connected by large cables to a cylindrical generator in the room, [[Yang Tieh]] began talking with the Drow, asking him what sort of work he was doing in this place. The Drow man began laughing hysterically and replied "I'm modifying them...Would you like to be modified?" He also told [[Yang Tieh]] that he was putting what he referred to as [[Fractines]] into the body lying on the table.

The party then began to feel several increasingly violent rumbles pervade throughout the caverns that seemed to be originating from elsewhere, possibly back outside the caverns where the battle continues between the [[Everwatchers]] and [[House Xorlarrin]]. When one particular violent rumble occurred, the [[Drow]] figure looked up and became even more manic as he started shouting "Can you see them? They're beautiful!"

At this point, two polygonal forms manifested, seemingly made out of the space of the room itself and make teleporting around and seemed to rearrange the space as the walls shifted and were replaced from where they once were. [[Yang Tieh]] quickly slit the throat of the [[Drow]] male figure, causing his body to crumple to the ground. One of the entities teleported into the adjacent room and began attacking and teleporting around what appeared to be a patrol of [[Drow]] guards while the second entity attacked you.

The entity converged on [[Yang Tieh]] and formed itself around him as Yang suddenly disappeared and reappeared trapped inside of a dark and starry expanse and the party was able to see him like a mirrored reflection within the space of the entity itself. The party eventually destroyed the creature causing [[Yang Tieh]] to be ejected from within the starry expanse where he was trapped.

You then continued through the laboratory into another checkpoint where you found a number of crates where you found [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s gear and other interesting items on the bodies of the guards themselves.

You exited this room and came to a dead-ended circular room with a single doorway wrapped in a shadowy purple essence which appeared to be a portal to somewhere else as you saw an ornate dining room beyond the door way with a very different aesthetic than anything you've seen here in these caverns, reminding you more of [[Aerilon]] nobility.

[[Teymir]] soon saw a familiar number of five human figures lying dead at the table with their heads lying in their plates and their throats all cut. He recognized this to be the same villa belonging to [[House Cassalanter]] you entered as you came up from the underground temple below the [[Dessarin Valley]] where some of you you saw the exact same sight.

You learned from the [[Drow]] female still accompanying you that she in fact was the one who had infiltrated this villa and assassinated these figures. As she was communicating with you by drawing on the ground, she also drew a 2-dimensional image of the dodecahedron and pointed through the door way as if to indicate that it lied ahead. [[Teymir]] took note that it was strange that she somehow knew that device would be significant to your group and why she was apparently interested in it as well.

You all then walked through the door way and entered the villa where you soon began to hear the sound of an old phonograph playing jazz music that seemed to echo through the entire floor of the villa. [[Gerard Vos]] began to search some of the bodies and determined that the bodies haven't appeared to decompose even the the wounds on their necks showed signs of the blood drying and he could tell the wounds were made a long time ago. Out a large window in the room, [[Teymir]] saw the distant backdrop of the [[House Xorlarrin Citadel]] connected to the villa via a narrow mountain path without any sides and a deep and seemingly endless drop on both sides.

[[Teymir]] once again reached out with his mind, possibly trying to make contact with [[Dak Grella]] and beyond, and a familiar chaotic and violent presence once again tried to take over his mind, and seemingly did so successfully for a moment as [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] watched him suddenly walk over, open the window overlooking the mountainous depths, and attempt to jump. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] successfully wrestled him to the ground and managed to bring him back to his wits.

You all then soon made your way to a billiard room not far from the dining room where you once again encountered [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] as he had just begun a game of pool. [[Yang Tieh]] instinctively filled with anger, threw his spear into the middle of the table as he was asked by Symund if he'd like to join in on a game. He then poured you all drinks as he began to share that his mission to acquire the [[Sirin Beacons]] and your's were still one and the same. He also shared that he had lost a younger brother of his up in this villa many years ago who had suddenly disappeared one day when he ran out to play. He said that ever since his brother's disappearance, his father has held him responsible and he's been sort of a "black sheep" in the Cassalanter family. He shared his brother's name was [[Aldous Cassalanter]]. He shared that when he saw this door way leading into this villa, he had no doubt it must mean there was something here to find Aldous. 

He also shared that the individuals lying dead at the table were very distant family who were generations old, who he had only seen in family portraits and archives. He was perplexed why they would be here.

You all continued your conversation in the billiard room with him.

And that's where we pick up....

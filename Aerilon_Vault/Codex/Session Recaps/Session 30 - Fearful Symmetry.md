#recap 
# Last we left off...
Finding a safe place to regroup 1 hour's distance from the giant creature, the majority of the party took a brief rest as [[Teymir]] investigated the cream colored stone discovered around the giant's neck. He noticed that the stone was slightly warmer to the touch that he would expect. [[Elleanna Corvus]] attempted to heal what she believed to be a curse upon or within her body. However, as he cast a remove curse spell on her arm, she watched as a magical reaction took place, resulting in blue light coming out of a few wounds on her arm and causing a small fiery explosion, causing minor burns on her arm.

[[Rushnaa]] eventually made it to the logging camp to warn [[Robinson Fellweather]] about the shadowy creature making its way to the camp. Robinson and [[Jovi]] quickly prepared to make their way out of the camp as they soon realized the shadow had sped up at some point and was right behind Rushnaa. It made its way into the camp and passed over all the bodies lying in the camp, causing them to animate with the sound of ravenous hissing and growling. As Robinson and Jovi ran from the camp, a formerly deceased boy and woman began chasing them on all fours into the forest. Robinson saw that their presence seemed to have an effect on whatever is present in Jovi's body as the severity of it seemed to increase as the boy and women grew closer.

Eventually, Robinson managed to stop the ravenous boy and woman with a well placed shard of ice that exploded, killing them both. Robinson soon began to hear the same hissing and growling sounds of a larger group of creatures in the distance. He and Jovi quickly mounted the boar and sped off deeper into the woods as Rushnaa guided them. They eventually made it to the camp where the part mounted together and sped off in search of the edge of the forest. As you rode, [[Yang Tieh]] noticed that behind you a long tunnel of wilting trees began to quickly form in your wake. A large shadow quickly overtook you, causing [[Kaya]] and the boar to buck all of you off as they panicked in fear. As you began to confront this creature, you began to notice that it seemed to have a resistance to magical and physical damage and seemed to drain the life of all things organic around it.

You also saw an Elven female face with ashen gray skin and glowing eyes that seemed to be the physical manifestation of this otherwise incorporeal form. The creature eventually levitated up to [[Teymir]] in the air and stated, "So...You're a hunter as well....Impressive." At which point it teleported far away from you and began making its way back in the direction of [[Kheldell]]. The other 15 residents of the logging camp that had been chasing you soon caught up with you as you sought shelter in a barrier Robinson built to protect you. You watched as normal-looking men, women, and children jumped onto the sphere and began biting and clawing it, almost seeming to be trying to suck something out of the sphere itself at times. You got the sense that had there been more of them, the sphere might not have kept you as safe as it did.

You began to attack and kill all the creatures who did not recoil or retreat in spite of their increasing drop in numbers. Blow after blow you bludgeoned fellow human beings while Jovi cowered in the corner of the sphere, hiding her eyes and horrified beyond belief. After you managed to kill all of the creatures, [[Yang Tieh]] began to investigate one of the bodies, removing the fanged tooth of the creature and pouring black liquid from a vial he procured in the underground temple. He watched as a putrid fungus began to grow out of the body's eyes and a low guttural inhaled of air struggled to pass through the lungs of the body but seemed to not be strong enough to last. As Yang laid down to sleep, he thought about the shadow creature and the more than 100 bodies lying in the grounds of Kheldell...and that's where we pick up.

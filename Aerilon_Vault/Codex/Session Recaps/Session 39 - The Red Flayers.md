#recap 
# Last we left off...

Your party was violently introduced to the people and culture of the [[Red Flayers]] as [[Teymir]] squared off against [[Insk]], a figure displaying a mix of [[Hobgoblin]], Human, and [[Draconic]] features. Over the course of their battle near the open door marketplace of [[Baraskur]], [[Elleanna Corvus]] also got involved, despite [[Klovag]]'s warnings not to do so, by attempting to aid [[Teymir]], which resulted in another Hobgoblin individual like Insk getting involved and entering the fray. You quickly realized this culture to have something of a code when it comes to challenges like this. You watched as Insk connected a necrotic thread between himself and Teymir's body causing necrotic energy to surge through the thread any time Teymir damaged him. You also saw Insk breath lightning from his mouth at one point in the battle, attempting to subdue Teymir who had hidden behind a nearby fire barrel.

Teymir soon fell unconscious to his wounds suffered at Insk's hands, prompting [[Yang Tieh]] to get involved and Yang took advantage of Insk's wounds suffered in his fight with Teymir and soon killed him, cutting off his long braid and throwing it into one of the nearby fire barrels. Yang then heard the roar of another nearby Hobgoblin who you later learned was one of Insk's brothers who attempted to also enter the battle.

You then heard the scoffing tone of a voice high above from the humanoid status structure in the cave wall as you saw [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] standing with two winged creatures and speaking in a language you didn't understand (except [[John Smith]]). All the people standing by looked up to him in cult-like fashion as he spoke at which point the fighting ceased and you learned that you had been commissioned to fight in what [[Klovag]] referred to as "The Pit" tomorrow against the rest of Insk's brothers.

Klovag then lead you to his home to stay the night and you learned that the [[Red Flayers]] took Klovag from his family when he was young and that Blazbaard continues to use Klovag's family as leverage to coerce him to aid the Red Flayers and Blazbaard in their agendas. You also learned from Klovag that Blazbaard showed up in Baraskur one day with supernatural powers telling a story of being raised from the dead by a mysterious figure who told him to come to the [[Nether Mountains]]. You learned Blazbaard managed to win the hearts and minds of the people through his charisma and supernatural displays of necrotic power, and then passing on some of his abilities to others. You learned Blazbaard is an opportunist and very unlike the culture and values of the Red Flayers, that he is not one to willingly put himself in harm's way and that because of the cult-like following he has built, the people often follow him even to the abandonment of their own culture and values.

Klovag also told you that Blazbaard is currently trying to find a way into the same wrecked [[Netherese]] spelljamming vessel that you are in order to free many Red Flayers whom a Hobgoblin known as [[Oknag the Mad]] has captured for purposes he didn't specify. He told you that the Red Flayers were once willingly in the service of a clan of [[Blue Dragons]] in the Nether Mountains known as the [[Blood of Moureme]], who occupied an ancient fortress in the mountains called the [[Doomspire]]. This clan rewarded some of the most adept warriors of the Red Flayers by breeding with them and increasing their capabilities and power. Oknag was one of the most adept and slew one of the blue dragons once he was transformed. He then amassed a large following among the Red Flayers and other Hobgoblins living in the Nether Mountains and slew the rest of the blue dragons in the mountains. Klovag told you that he now occupies this Netherese vessel and his likely either killed Kwalish or taking him for interrogation. Klovag emphasized Blazbaard is worried about his leadership being questioned as weak by the Red Flayers, which would likely mean his life, if he's not able to resuce the captured Red Flayers from Oknag. He told you that Blazbaard currently has him researching a way to synthetically transform the Hobgoblins into the Hobgoblin/Draconic hybrid without the natural breeding process required. He said some results have been more successfully than others. You learned that Insk and his brothers were some of these test subjects as well as many of the more aggressive fighters of the Red Flayers.

You discovered many of Klovag's research efforts were being conducted on the other side of a secret wall in his room that several of you entered into.

Klovag purchased two enslaved [[Tiefling]] women for [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] who decided they would travel into the open market in disguise to scope out the area in preparation for your right in the pit tomorrow. The two enslaved Tielfling women stand in chains in front of you as you have convened in the small and cozy room of Klovag's cavern dwelling.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

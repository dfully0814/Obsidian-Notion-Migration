#recap 
# Last we left off...
You began at a campsite with [[Krol]] as you continued to attempt to persuade him regarding [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]]'s malicious intent and the likelihood of Blazbaard believing the ruse you had previously come up with. Krol shared with you his passion for his people and you watched his facial expressions as he wrestled with the idea of leaving his people behind in Blazbaard's hands with little understanding of what he wanted with GP120. He eventually agreed to lead you forward to the cavern containing the portal back to [[Amphail]].

You set out on a 7-hour journey down the Nether Mountains, passing another route without going through [[Baraskur]]. As you journeyed and the hours passed, [[Teymir]] and [[Yang Tieh]] discussed their past difficulties relating to one another, realizing their common desire for answers regarding both the mystery you currently pursue as well as their own personal answers they are seeking. Teymir expressed his willingness to help Yang discover what has transpired in his home of [[Thornhold]] and help him discover what must be done.

As you continued traveling, you began to both hear and feel something following you behind the icy stone walls and the floor. A few hours passed as an unknown entity seemed to be tracking you. Soon, Krol stopped the party to caution you regarding something tracking you. As he spoke, a large salamander-like creature with six razor-sharp clawed feet and piercing teeth burst up from directly underneath you. It had bluish-gray skin with an underbelly that seemed to glow and swirl with bright blue energy with periodic small red explosions occurring throughout. Catching [[Elleanna Corvus]] and Teymir off guard, it began attacking the party with a barrage of freezing cold energy that seemed to build at its tail and surge through its body and exhaling from its mouth. After several devastating blows of this energy and many members of your party were brought to near death several times.

Being brought to near death for her first time since joining the party, Ell's psyche began to increasingly splinter as long black tendrils began sprouting from her body and reaching into the creature, draining its life and replenishing her's. She began to cackle with delight as more and more life was drained from the creature.

Teymir discovered that the creature was not out to kill you. Instead, it seemed to be hungry for the energy contained within your suits of armor. Screaming at Ell to stop hurting the creature and realizing she was unresponsive in her splintered state, Teymir fired a concussive blast from his suit of armor, knocking Ell unconscious once again but preventing her from damaging the creature further.

As you began to dislodge yourselves from your armor, some relinquishing the armor more reluctantly than others, the creature began dragging each suit of armor to a hole it created in the ice and began dropping each suit down the hole, soon following after them once all suits had been drug down the hole.

You are now armorless, cold, and bloody from wounds inflicted by the creature. Silence once again takes over the cavern tunnel you are in.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

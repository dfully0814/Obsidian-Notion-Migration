# Last we left off...
As a dark and malicious essence poured through a large crack in the wall of the [[Cassalanter Mountain Villa]] wine cellar, [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] slowly lowered a katana he had wrested from [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s grasp when [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] attempted to attack him in a rage seemingly brought on my whatever presence was carried with the dark mist billowing into the room. [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] and [[Gerard Vos]] began to back out of the room to meet back with [[Teymir]] who had remained behind to watch over [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Yang Tieh]] in their unconscious state. As he left the room, [[Gerard Vos]] happened to see the winged shadow creature escape through the large crack in the wall.

[[Teymir]] attempted to reach out to [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Yang Tieh]] and found the consciousness of [[Dak Grella]] who warned [[Teymir]] about opening his mind up in this place with the malevolent forces saturating every corner of it. [[Dak Grella]] offered to carry [[Teymir]]'s message in his place to his friends, again warning [[Teymir]] that he sensed a powerful presence near as he reached out with his mind that was unlike anything he had ever felt. He promised to try and reach out further in [[Teymir]]'s stead.

Meanwhile, inside a mysterious, snow-covered area where [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Yang Tieh]] continued their fight with the repitilian creatures attacking them, [[Elleanna Corvus]] barely hanging on to her life. Angrily, [[Yang Tieh]] shouted to the skies, "What else do you want from us??," at which a booming voice replied:

> [[Yang Tieh]], long have you gilded your fear of your finitude and mortality with a forbidding and harsh resolution. It has lead to a craving for power and knowledge the likes of which your kind should never possess. In spite of the regular apprehensions of your companions you pledged loyalty to an entity you knew who promised power that you believed you could one day use to redeem your failure and shame which lead to your exile from your countrymen. And now, you, along with the other weak-willed ones like you do [[Auril]]'s bidding, carrying pieces of the [[Arc Infinitus]] across [[The Fold]] to the very threshold of her domain and she builds her armies! Now, you will prove if you are willing to face that which you so fear and if your follies can still be excised from within you or else your story ends here!!

At this point, a 30ft-wide beam of lightning shot down from the sky and began charging up on the ground as a coiling serpent entity made of pure energy began to coil out and around the beam, spawning 6 heads. 

Meanwhile in the villa, another series of lightning bolts shot out of [[Yang Tieh]]'s spear, striking [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] while [[Teymir]] had just grabbed the spear itself, transporting both of them to the same snow-covered area as their bodies fell unconscious, leaving only [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] behind in the villa.

After being transported in first, [[Teymir]] ran to help [[Yang Tieh]] fight the ice creatures and managed to defeat the final creature. When [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], continuing in his altered mental state, was transported into the snow area following [[Teymir]], where he first saw [[Elleanna Corvus]] lying on the ground covered by a heavy coat [[Teymir]] gave her. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] managed to sneak up to her, knock her unconscious, and then cover her with snow as he then walked out to find [[Teymir]] and [[Yang Tieh]].

As the coiling form of a reptilian creature coalesced from the large beam of lightning, [[Yang Tieh]] began to walk over to it as he threw his spear to the ground, took off the top of his robe, extended his arms and began shouted at the entity, "I only serve myself. I pledged loyalty to [[Auril]] because she gave me power. What power do you have to give? Show me your power." At this point the entity asked [[Yang Tieh]] if he was afraid to die as one of the heads inhaled and breathed out a blinding beam of energy, disintegrating [[Yang Tieh]] where he stood. [[Teymir]] looked on and threw up on the ground seeing [[Yang Tieh]] obliterated in an instant. [[Teymir]] then ran over to find [[Elleanna Corvus]] who he found covered by the snow after blowing back a layer of it telepathically. 

The entity then turned to [[Teymir]] and shouted, "Where is the one who serves [[Auril]] yet still." After a few moments, [[Teymir]] realized the entity was referring to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], and he ran over to find [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] who had now successfully hidden from him. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] then jumped out of the snow, grabbed [[Elleanna Corvus]] and put his dagger up to her throat.

[[Teymir]] began to plead with [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], telling him to remember their relationship, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] expressing his distrust of [[Teymir]] and saying he would just hand him over to this entity. [[Teymir]] said that they would approach the entity together and that he would always have his back. [[Teymir]] was able to press through whatever influence had come over [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] as he let go of [[Elleanna Corvus]] and the three either walked or were teleported over to the entity, where the entity looked at all of you and said, "It is only with these bonds that you will break the curse," at which point the entire area was pulled into itself and [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Teymir]], and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] were shunted back into the villa and down the steps. As she settled herself, [[Elleanna Corvus]] quickly looked over to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], grabbed a dagger and lunged at him before being blocked by [[Teymir]] and shoved into the wall.

[[Yang Tieh]] opened his eyes in a green-lit circular room where spheres of green energy pulsed all around. Before him stood a slender figure in black clothing with a hood over its head and a yin-yang face mask wielding a black spear identical to his. From under the mask he heard a voice identical to his say, "It's been a long time. Knowing you the way I do, I thought you'd have been here sooner." When [[Yang Tieh]] asked who the figure was, it responded, "I'm you. More or less. Don't look so surprised. This is how things have worked for a long time for people like you and me. Now get off the ground and pick up your spear." At this point a fight ensued between [[Yang Tieh]] and the figure in this mysterious and unknown place.

And that's where we pick up...

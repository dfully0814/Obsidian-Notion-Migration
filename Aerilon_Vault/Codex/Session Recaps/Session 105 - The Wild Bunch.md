#recap 
# Last we left off...

You started aboard the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]] in route to [[Luskan]] as a man with ungroomed hair and facial hair, with frostbite along his hands and face, conversed with [[Gerard Vos]] and eventually the rest of your party. He introduced himself as [[Murlough Grahlund]]. [[Gerard Vos]] found it odd that someone from such a wealthy and reputable noble house would look the way [[Murlough Grahlund]] did. [[Murlough Grahlund]] shared that he had responsibilities to tend far north of [[Luskan]] and inquired some regarding your party's endeavors and interests in [[Luskan]]. Seeing that trust was hard to come by across the board, [[Murlough Grahlund]] told [[Gerard Vos]] that he might be open to talking more if you all got a little more familiar. 

After introducing himself to the rest of the party, and each of the party providing a fake name to him, [[Murlough Grahlund]] said his goodbyes and warned you as he left to keep an eye out since this is dangerous country to in which to travel.

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Gerard Vos]] then made their way to the bar and began to discuss the tragic occurrences at [[Vos Industries]]. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] asked what the party should look for exactly at [[Vos Industries]]. [[Gerard Vos]] shared some regarding the reactor that [[Vos Industries]] has developed that could potentially become the first source of renewable energy in [[Aerilon]]. This seemed to be what [[Gerard Vos]] was most concerned about the [[Everwatchers]] finding since this was a very "off the books" project not sanctioned by the [[Everwatchers]] and could spell the end for [[Vos Industries]] all together and anyone associated with it if it were found. [[Gerard Vos]] also expressed his fear regarding if the reactor itself fell into the wrong hands.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] discussed some of the recent happenings, specifically [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s vision of [[Tanavast Adamantus]] and [[Leowin Moonflower]] standing darkly at [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]]'s side. As they talked [[Elleanna Corvus]] remarked about the maturity and change she has seen come over [[Teymir]] since the [[House Xorlarrin Citadel Caverns]]. She revealed to [[Teymir]] her discovery that [[Leowin Moonflower]] was her sister as well as her discovery that [[The Guide]] is [[Teymir]]'s mother--in spite of [[The Guide]] telling her not to share it. She also told [[Teymir]] that [[The Guide]] referred to him as "Ildan." She continued by telling [[Teymir]] vague details about her vision where she heard her father referred to by the name [[Elestor]]. [[Teymir]] stayed silent and took all of it in, telling [[Elleanna Corvus]] that though he doesn't trust [[Galladon]] or [[The Guide]], anyone who is apparently against [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]] is worth making an alliance with for now. 

[[Teymir]], [[Gerard Vos]], and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] then made their way into the dining car where they were served a hearty meal over some fine drinks. [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] remained in the first class car as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] marveled through the window at the snowy countryside beyond. As he watched the quickly passing tree line, he suddenly noticed a figure as tall as the trees barreling toward the train. As he swirled his hands and cast Dissonant Whispers, the party felt the entire train lift high off the ground as the windows were blown out by what looked like surging green beams of energy before the entire train then quickly plummeted to the ground.

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Teymir]] awoke inside their respective train cars with smoke filling the space and choking them, they each found a way out onto the top of the train that appeared to have been tipped over on its side. In the distance they saw a group of large giant creatures with axes the size of oak trees cleaving in impossible wide circles at groups of [[Everwatch Knights]] on the ground. [[Teymir]] then looked on the other side of the train to see what appeared to be a female giant barreling up the hill. Her body was surrounded in a swirling vortex mixture of what looked like sharp ice and snow and she wore loose fitting cloth garments and a hood pulled over her head with blue glowing eyes.

As [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] both looked and called out for [[Gerard Vos]], [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] they heard no answer and didn't see them in the vicinity of the train.

And that's where we pick up...

#recap 
# Last we left off...
After receiving a mortally wounding blast from [[Tick-Clack]], [[Elleanna Corvus]] opened her eyes to see herself as a young girl, her feet dangling over the edge of a long dock and a view of a distant city shrouded in darkness with thousands of green glowing lanterns rising to the sky from within it. She sensed she had been to this city before but it didn't look as it did now. She began talking with her mother who she saw walking toward her down the dock. Her mother asked her what she thought of the city, telling her "They say [[Neverwinter]] is one of the Jewels of the North. We should be proud of your father for being stationed here."

Her mother went on to muse over the beauty of the sea, sharing that the Elvish word for sea is "Airon" which means "empty" or "to empty out". She told Ell that's how the land of [[Aerilon]] got its name. After the [[Calamity]], people started over lead by the Elves, and Aerilon was their new start in a life apart from the gods. She then began to cry, beginning to plead with Ell that she too could start over. She told Ell that she saw her in her room the previous evening practicing magic. She began to plead with her and warn her of the consequences of what could happen to her or her father if she was discovered. She also warned her of her duty to report her to the [[Everwatchers]] if she saw her practicing again.

As though there were a subtle shift in the memory; this part not something that Ell remembered from before…her mother slightly changed the tone of her voice, and began to tell her a story of a city called [[Gloomwrought]] where the people once believed that their existence depended on living on in the memory of those whom they loved and those who loved them. So every year they would make decorative magical lanterns, thousands of them. They called it the [[Festival of Memories]]. They would light these lanterns, shut off all the lights to the city, and release them into the sky. They believed the magical properties of these lanterns could carry the memories of the deceased and the living across the land so they would never be forgotten. She told her that one day a terrible curse came to the city and they all stopped remembering and stopped making lanterns and the festival was forgotten. She began to warn Ell that there is a "bridge" between life and chaos built upon the memories of the living and the dead, and that there are forces who seek to destroy this bridge. She told her that she would learn more in time but she should help her friends and remain watchful and vigilant. She was then given a finely made porcelain white mask that she held in her hands as she awoke in the underground area below [[Evelyn's General Store]].

[[Mary Emsworth]] told Ell she was fortunate that the malady did not attack her from the inside. She seemed to indicate she wouldn't have been able to help her if she had. She said that the malady seems to remove all character and memory of an individual.

You then opened the sphere and were pressed down to a quantum level with tremendous force and blasted to the [[Nether Mountains]] where you fell in upon a raging battle between a group of goblinoid individuals and large ravenous centipede creatures that seemed to exhibit characteristics of both fire and ice externally and internally. Not knowing whether these humanoid individuals could be trusted, you faced off primarily against the centipede creatures until [[Robinson Fellweather]]'s well placed acid knife spell burst upon the largest centipede sending a rain of corrosive acid down upon three individuals fighting it, killing them, and insighting the rage of another red-skinned goblinoid individual who seemed to be leading them as he began to fight Robinson, chasing him to his death as the largest centipede grabbed him in its maw, crushing him, and sucking him down its throat.

The battle in this cavern continues to rage, [[Teymir]] and [[Yang Tieh]] beginning to soon feel the effects of the frigid water on their bodies, Ell attempting to win over an arcanist individual on the icy overlook 50ft above the ongoing fight below.

And that's where we pick up…

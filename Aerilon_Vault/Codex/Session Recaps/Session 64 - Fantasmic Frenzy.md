# Last we left off...
You picked up in the mining town of [[Phandalin]] on the night of the [[Day of Wonders]] parade conducted by the [[Sea Maiden's Faire]]. [[Azure Flint]] began by making his way to [[Ms. Florina's Fantasmagoria]] where he also conversed with the strange red-skinned, stringy haired female figure where we drew a small puppy from her bag, a ball of electrical energy, was awarded a powerful sword, and last everything valuable he owns, including his ship during the visit. He made off with some ivory tusks which she allowed him to have in exchange for a bird's foot he magically convinced her to believe was more valuable than it actually was. More impressed by her abilities than outraged at the loss of most of what he owns, he gave his name and contact information over to her as he left the tent and told her to contact him if she comes across anything else "interesting."

Azure then made his way to a local [[Valkurians]] contact in Phandalin whom he originally sponsored into the Valkurians, a former [[Zhentarim]] agent named [[Halia Thornton]]. Azure knows her to be a professional smuggler and runner of illegal contraband, particularly small arms and ammunition. He gave her the magical axe he had acquired in the underground temple and asked her to sell it for him. Magically convincing her as well that the axe was more valuable than it actually was, she offered him 1500 gold but also telling him she didn't have the money currently and he would have to come by her shop the next morning, Azure realizing that she will likely offer less once the spell has worn off.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] continued talking in the [[Sleeping Giant Inn]] where Teymir told Ell about finding out that some aspect of his family might still be alive and also sharing with Ell what he discovered regarding [[Zardoz Zord]]'s connections in [[Waterdeep]] and the quid-pro-quo that had begun between Teymir and Zord regarding the acquisition of an item Zord is interested in which is being held in a Everwatch Knight cache in the caves of [[Mt Hotenow]]. You briefly discussed possibly trying to acquire the item and make off with it yourselves if it would aid you in getting into Waterdeep.

Back near the city center, [[Gerard Vos]] looked on as the hulking 6-darmed demonic figure in front of him, spoke once again and said, "Now you will see the kind of suffering that you will bring," at which point the figure opened its gaping maw wide and let out a frightened and panicked moan sending the entire city center into a panicked murderous frenzy as citizens and Everwatch Knights began attacking one another, the Everwatch Knights trying desperately to protect the city and one another. At the epicenter of the frenzy stood Yang as he expertly began frenzied citizens in droves, fighting alongside the knights to dispatch the entire orchestra in the city center and then moving outward. Ell and Teymir soon jumped in to help, taking a vantage point on the top of the building where a festival drinking contest was being held.

As the moaning of the creature continued to reach wider into the city, Vos found himself unable to withstand its frenzied influence after several minutes and also succumbed to the frenzy as he began to fire on citizens and Everwatch Knights, killing a large group of citizens and 7 knights by himself. Teymir also narrowly escaped the frenzied and panicked influence as he dropped to his knees, clutching his head.

After a few minutes the creature let out a powerful frenzied surge from its location, shattering building windows within 500 ft of its location and sending the nearby Everwatch Knights into an equal frenzy. You looked on as they began to run low on frenzied citizens to attack and some began looking around for signs of other more distant threats.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

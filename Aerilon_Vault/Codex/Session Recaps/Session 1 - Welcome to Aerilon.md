[[Teymir]] met an orphan boy named [[Bo]]. Had breakfast with him and then gave him 1gp to keep an eye out on things around the [[Dock Ward]] while Teymir is gone. Teymir saw a couple of [[Everwatch Knights]] escorting a robed prisoner into the inner wards of the city. Teymir met a shady merchant in a side alley of the dock ward and purchased several magic items from him for 15gp, a very cheap price. Teymir also found out from him that he had stolen these items from a [[Drow]] and was trying to get rid of them.

#recap 
# Last we left off...
Near the eastern side of the temple, the party decided that [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Teymir]] would squeeze through the triangular stone you had found, while [[Azure Flint]], [[Tanavast Adamantus]], and [[John Smith]] would venture down the previous down the hallway that Azure and Teymir had before noticed was filled with bodies standing in niches carved into the wall on each side. Teymir and Yang pushed through the 2ft gap between the corridor wall and the triangular stone, making their way down a 40ft long corridor.

Near the end of the corridor, Teymir saw two decorative archways separated by about 15ft. As Teymir and Yang neared the second archway they felt a 10ft x 10ft section of the floor beneath them sink into the ground slightly as they heard the sound of ancient gears turning, sending two iron portcullis doors down to block each archway. Reacting quickly, they both managed to roll forward beyond the second portcullis door as it slammed shut, just slashing Teymir some in the back as he narrowly made it through behind Yang. As the two made their way around the corner, they saw a bronze double door at the end of another short corridor that seemed to have a rectangular glass window cut into it at eye level and another rectangular seam cut into the door lower down.

The room seemed to be filled with dark orange lights haphazardly darting around the room. As Teymir approached the door to look through what he realized was an observation window, about 15 of the dark orange lights perched onto the window, revealing that the lights were actually the glowing abdomens of tiny beetles. Through some experimentation, Yang and Teymir learned that the beetles only flew to the door when Teymir walked near it. Teymir discovered that the lower carved seam had a handle attached to it that resembled a drawer handle. Pulling it open, he found a couple wands lying in it all with abstract decorative designs that he recognized were similar designs seen on the silver coffer previously. He noticed these wands looked like they had been eaten and were in various stages of disrepair. Yang then decided to enter the room on his own, leaving Teymir in the corridor.

As Yang entered the room, he saw bright green foliage all around--ferns, small trees, large plants--reminding him of something like a butterfly house. In the middle of the room were a pile of bodies all dressed in various robes, all seemed well preserved. In one corner of the room he saw a stack of staves and wands. He also saw a metal chute protruding 5ft out of the ceiling, a dark blue glowing glyph on the ground near where the bodies were piled, and what looked like a workbench and alchemist cabinet in an opposite corner of the room. When he explored the stone workbench, Yang found 3 vials of various colored liquids and viscosities--dark and extremely thick, thin and red, and medium viscosity and dark orange.

He began by pouring some of the liquids directly onto the workbench. The dark liquid caused a fungus to quickly grow that seemed to attempt to eat the stone from which it grew from, the red liquid seemed to mend a crack in the stone on the workbench, and the dark orange liquid had no effect. Yang than poured the red liquid onto the hand of the vampiric creature you encountered in the burial chamber. He noticed the skin on the hand seemed to become more vibrant, although still ashen gray. When he poured the dark orange liquid on it, the hand violently animated with surprising strength and latched onto Yang's throat. Yang then drank the orange liquid, causing his body to become paralyzed and he previously experienced in the diorama room, but with greater degrees of pain surging through his muscles.

As [[Azure Flint]], [[John Smith]], and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] made their way down the other corridor, they observed that the bodies were in various states of suspended decomposition, some more well-preserved than others. All of them seemed to have a sickening green fungus growing in and out of their bodies which seemed to thread their bodies together, hands were much longer than normal, some had jaws missing with tongues hanging to waist level or longer, some had missing arms up to the shoulder replaced by long hanging tentacles, the ones that did have arms the arms were hanging down to the ground, feet were long and deformed, toes coming to triangular types, some more curved in shape almost like bird talons. One of the figures Azure noticed seemed to have some kind of acid or putrid green material explode from its mouth and it was splattered all over the face.

Azure, John Smith, and Tanavast then entered a pill-shaped room containing two large stone tables. One contained a male Elven figure in a state of suspended decomposition with a set of 6 glassy white eyes on the face, a thin layer of gray fur along its body, long fingers that came to triangular sharp tips. The second table contained a female Elven figure with a mouth full of razor sharp, bony teeth, the same set of 6 glassy white eyes, thin layer of gray fur, and long clawed fingers. In between the two stone tables Azure found a smaller stone table with two empty goblets and a flask sitting on it. Azure took the flask that seemed to have some kind of liquid inside of it but it was capped and the flask was opaque so he has yet to investigate it.

Azure, John Smith, and Tanavast then converged on the same beetle-filled room from the south that Yang and Teymir already approached from the east. Teymir watched as he approached the door, half of the beetle swarm flew to the southern door suddenly while the rest stayed perched on his door. Both Teymir and Azure soon realized that in the presence of the beetles, magic seemed to not work correctly and was either suppressed or automatically dispelled.

Seeing Yang paralyzed and in peril in the corner of the room, Azure burst through the double doors, watching as the ravenous swarm of beetles surrounded him and began biting him and trying to drain his arcane abilities. He and John Smith successfully moved Yang's body to the eastern door before Azure succumbed to the swarm's attacks. You then began an arduous encounter with this swarm, eventually leaving Tanavast alone with the swarm in the corridor, who did not seem to attract the attacks of the swarm despite his apparent magical abilities, alone in the eastern corridor alone with the swarm, whacking and swinging at them with fury and rage in his eyes while the rest of the party regrouped in the main room.

[[Azure Flint]] and [[Teymir]], you were given a mission by your [[Valkurians]] brothers, specifically [[Sighi Thorgison]], Teymir's mentor, to retrieve a "lost asset" from [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]] near the fortress town of **[[Thornhold]]**.

Boarding a ship named the [[Dawn Chaser]] captained by [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]], you set out together to recover a lost asset you knew to be important to The Valkurians.

Once docked at the island containing the lighthouse, you met a mysterious monk named [[Yang Tieh]] who you later learned was also a Valkurian agent working for the **Thornhold** cell in search the same lost asset as yourselves.

The three of you made your way into the lighthouse, doing battle with some Elven creatures with dark skin and a stone **Dwarven** figure, you infiltrated the lighthouse, making contact with [[Lucien Skyhorn]], the owner of the lighthouse, who soon shoved a necklace of red beads into his mouth upon noticing your infiltration, destroying himself and almost several of you.

In the cavern of the lighthouse, you encountered creatures of various races locked in large cages and eventually made your way to a large room where a small girl was being guarded and several figures who bound and chained lined up side by side. Combat ensued, resulting in the girl drawing lightning energy into herself creating a superstorm in the middle of the cavern. With the girl in tow, you made your way out of the cavern and toward **The Dawn Chaser** to escape.

After witnessing tremendous displays of power from the girl and having several conversations with her, you learned she was connected to some other entity she referred to as "he" who she believed to be controlling her destiny. She told you she had been kidnapped from her home of [[Evermeet]] and taken to the continent of [[Laerkond]] by a group she referred to as [[Shadovar]].

Making your way back to [[Waterdeep]], you encountered a ship sailing north up The [[Sword Coast]] where you met a former [[Everwatch Knights]] soldier named [[Tanavast Adamantus]] who told you he was heading toward the lighthouse because in Waterdeep there has already been word of what happened there. He believed he would also be able to help you sneak into Waterdeep if needed.

You eventually boarded his ship, bidding farewell to the crew of **The Dawn Chaser,** and sailed back south, eventually reaching a beach where you encountered mercenaries armed with laser pistols. You followed a few of them into a forested area where you met a seemingly noble [[Harpers]] agent named [[Captain Alford Ainsley]], who had come to the area to excavate an underground temple dedicated to an "ancient god of the underworld."

The party has accepted to help him retrieve what he referred to as Spell Lenses developed as either the result or process of the [[Netherese]] study of [[Arcane Transmogrification]], which he told you they believed was a process the Netherese used to transform or manipulate arcane chaotic energy as its pulled from [[Weave]]. He mentioned that from what they know about the technology, the Harpers are concerned about this technology falling into the wrong hands and have sent him to this area to excavate an underground temple "dedicated to an ancient god of the underworld".

You made your way hundreds of feet below ground into the temple below where you have encountered mysterious dioramas and statues depicting an ancient tribal culture and its daily life mingled with encounters with various alien or ethereal creatures that seem to have more malevolent intent, your first encounter with some of those creatures resulting in [[Leowin Moonflower]]'s death by her own her hand.

You have observed a strange dark haze permeating throughout every area you have entered so far except the first diorama room and hallway that you entered, which seemed to be blocked by the bronze double doors.

As you've talked to various entities, they have seemed to know some of your more persona secrets, as well as some of your names. Yang and [[Azure Flint]] have been specifically mentioned by name thus far.

You continue to enter strange rooms that seem to have been recreated to exhibit certain scenes and most recently have found yourselves in conflict with a beautiful Elven female figure made up entirely of water, some large water creatures (one eel-like and one serpent-like), and a new much more pale Elven figure in dark leather garb carrying a large spiked chain. You have also witnessed a figure made of flame burst forth from Azure's book as he threw the book in the air, which had been enchanted with an exploding glyph. The figure has begun walking toward the exit from which you came. It has written in the ground in [[Primordials]], which Azure interpreted to mean "The beginning is ending."

[[John Smith]] rests at the bottom of a 12ft deep pool in the final death throes, while Tanavast attempts to pry him from the tentacled grip of the serpent creature above and Yang, Teymir, and Azure rush to begin pulling on a rope tied around Tanavast when he signals them.

# Last we left off...
[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]] picked up their conversation with [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] aboard the [[Dawn Chaser]]. As they talked, Moonlight told them that she had never navigated the [[Whalebone Islands]] and that the crew would need a quartermaster more skilled than [[Gregor]], her first mate, who is currently First Mate and Quartermaster to navigate these mostly uncharted islands. She told you that there are many myths and legends told among seafaring folk about disappearing ships and sailors who venture through the islands, as well as stories of sudden and violent storms brewing seemingly out of nowhere.

She mentioned that the ship would be stopping at an uninhabited island not far from the coast to pick up a former expert quartermaster and colleague who was marooned there. Robinson and Yang spent a night aboard the ship en route to the island, meeting and interacting with [[Paige]] and she brought breakfast in the morning. You eventually made it to the island where you met a boisterous half-orc named [[Barbara]]. Barbara told you that he was marooned on the island by choice since the last crew he was with he believed to be too incompetent to continue sailing with.

He boarded the Dawn Chaser with the rest of the crew and you began the voyage to an island in the Whalebones where Moonlight believed the [[Fortunate Son]] to be anchored as Barbara took the position of quartermaster and helped Moonlight navigate the season what would be a 3-day journey.

On the evening of the 2nd day of the journey, Yang began to feel a mysterious gravitational and electrical force tingle through his body that seemed to come in waves. After casting detect magic, Robinson saw a bright red glow coming from Yang's travel pack but didn't investigate further. As the voyage continued and you neared the island destination, Yang noticed the sensation in his body increase in intensity and seem to almost be pulling in the direction that the ship was heading.

At dusk of the 3rd day of your journey, the crew saw the first land body which Barbara identified as the island you were looking for. As the ship continued closing distance to the island, the crew found themselves sailing into thick fog, which soon mixed with rain and violent wind as the ship sailed into a violent storm that seemed to be emanating from the island in a very wide radius.

As the ship neared the island, Barbara saw a group of ship sails on the other side of the island. Looking through her spyglass, Moonlight recognized the crimson sails of the Fortunate Son. With an uncharacteristic reckless abandon, Moonlight issued a command for full sail in the direction of the island in the midst of the raging storm.

As the ship sped toward the island, Yang pulled out the metallic pyramid from his pack which he had acquired in the underground temple and began to feel an intense sure of static pressure in his hands as his hands seemed to almost form to the pyramid and the pyramid began to brightly glow with white blinding light. Suddenly, a large lightning bolt shot out of the pyramid toward the middle of the island, seeming to anchor itself somewhere in the middle of the island, which then began pulling the ship at breakneck speed in the direction of the island with incredible force.

Robinson managed to open a pocket dimension in which Yang successfully dropped the pyramid, causing the large bolt of lightning to retract back into the pyramid just as the pocket dimension was closing.

The leftover inertia from the unnatural speed of the ship caused the ship to heavily scrape along the western side of the island as Moonlight successfully prevented the ship from crashing into it head-on. Coming so close to the island, however, benefited the ship's ability to sail back out into the open sea undetected by the Fortunate Son's crew.

Coming up from behind the Fortunate Son in a lateral direction, Moonlight called for a full broadside against the Fortunate Son and proceeded to sail up alongside the ship preparing to board it. As the Dawn Chaser neared the Fortunate Son, you saw two areas of the raging water near the ship begin to swirl up into the air, forming two large columns of water that seemed to form into figures.

The battle between the crew of the Dawn Chaser and Fortunate Son began to rage in the midst of the heavy fog, torrential rain, and devastating ocean waves all around you.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

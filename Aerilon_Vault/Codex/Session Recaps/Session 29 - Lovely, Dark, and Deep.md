#recap 
# Last we left off...
You continued your trek through the [[Westwood Forest]] in search of the large creature that had barreled through here the night before. Before reaching the area where the creature was killed, you came upon the first logging camp that [[Rushnaa]] had seen attacked during her scouting run earlier. As you approached the logging camp, you saw various body parts scattered 50-100ft outside the perimeter of the camp, the faces of the heads you found twisted and deformed and paralyzed with cries of fear. [[Rushnaa]] soon informed you that she had found a lone girl in one of the logging cottages and that the roof of one of the cottages would soon cave in. You made your way over to the half-destroyed cottage to find a young girl with short black hair maybe 8-9 years old sitting in the corner whimpering and terrified.

After [[Teymir]] began speaking with her and calming her down, he quickly rushed her out of the house safely where she began to realize the fullness of the devastation around her, bringing her almost to a panic. She began asking where her mother and father were. When she noticed the magical illusions that [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to use to appeal to her, she became even more afraid, begging the party not to hurt her and telling them that her father and mother always warned her about "apostates" and how dangerous they were. [[Robinson Fellweather]] began to appeal to her, helping her to see that this group was all she had at the moment and it would be better for her to throw in her lot with them than stay out in the camp alone, to which she eventually seemed to agree. Before leaving to investigate the giant creature, Ell left [[Jovi]] with one of the orange pebbles she found in the ash of the forest.

After holding it in her hand, [[Teymir]] noticed blackened veins begin to appear, running down her hand to her wrist, which matched already darker veins in her neck that he noticed but she hadn't. After gently asking her to put the pebble down, the darkened veins began to subside. Leaving [[Robinson Fellweather]] to watch over Jovi at the logging camp while she slept, the rest of the party continued to investigate the creature. Once you arrived, you saw the awe-inspiring sight of a 50ft long deformed giant creature lying face first on the ground. Its feet were deformed with longer toes growing out of various sides of the foot, its skin was hard like tree bark, it had a putrid green fungus growing out of its skin, creating large exit wounds with a clear waxen liquid running out of each wound. It was wearing a dented and scratched leather helm covering both eyes and half of the face with large curved ivory tusks growing out of the helmet.

You also found a 15ft long double-headed ask with a mysterious symbol engraved in it as well as a large cream-colored stone with another red mysterious symbol seemingly implanted within it and slightly glowing through the opaque finish of the stone. Yang discovered that the large axe was extremely cold to the touch, with what looked like flash frozen coagulated blood covering each axe head.

As Teymir and Ell both stared into one prominent yellow-orange eye of the creature, they experienced the tremendous terror of an excruciating pain that seemed to come from thousands of people at once. Angry and bitter at the horror of what she was witnessing, Ell ran up to the eye and stabbed it with her dagger, causing a flood of thick black liquid to flow from the socket of the eye and cover her. After clearing it somewhat from her body she began to notice cysts and wounds begin to open all over her body and face in leprous-like fashion and remaining that way. As the party deliberated where to go or what to do next, [[Rushnaa]] informed Teymir that she saw what looked like a 30ft wide shadow about 1 mile from your location traveling in the direction of the logging camp where Robinson and Jovi currently reside. And that's where we pick upâ€¦

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] continued his research with [[Damien]] in the [[Hall of Knowledge]] by now shifting his focus to [[House Cassalanter]] once he discovered that [[Edmur Cassalanter]] and [[Septizim Gamal]] are one and the same. He learned that [[House Cassalanter]] is one of the oldest and largest noble families in the history of [[Aerilon]]. He learned that [[Kwalish Tanthul]] and [[Edmur Cassalanter]] were brothers. He learned that [[Edmur Cassalanter]] was born in [[Thay]] and was nationalized by the [[Thayans]] at an early age when he was conscripted into the [[Thayan]] military.

[[Telamont Tanthul]], who had already joined the [[Council of Eight]] after his father, [[Rivalen Tanthul]]'s mysterious death, took [[Edmur Cassalanter]] under his wing. [[Edmur Cassalanter]] eventually became loyal to [[Telamont Tanthul]] and took his side when the civil war in [[Thay]] began. He was also exiled with [[Telamont Tanthul]] to [[Aerilon]] where it appears he began to particularly focus on experimentation regarding interplanar travel at a much larger scale than an individual level. However, this is where the facts ended and the speculation began.

[[Damien]] then escorted [[Asad Al-Nuri]] to an iron door separating the library proper from the undercroft leading to the [[Vault of Tomes]]. Through iron slats in this door, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]] met [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]], who seemed to have pale clammy skin with black veins throughout her arms and face and black stringy hair. She also seemed to wear a crimson blindfold over her eyes. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] handed over a holy book from [[Kerruma]] as an exchange for information regarding the [[Sirin Beacons]] and their possible whereabouts.

[[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] shared that a few locations of these mysterious artifacts are the only ones known. The first was previously in [[Nulmoria]], which had recently moved back over into [[Aerilon]]. The second was the ancient island of [[Evermeet]] believed to be the origin of the [[Elves]]. The third was right in the [[Vault of Tomes]] itself. [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] warned [[Asad Al-Nuri]] that the vault door must never be opened due to an unknown malevolent presence inside that she believes could threaten the entire realm. She didn't give much information about it other than the warning. 

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] offered to help and [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] shared that another possible entrance to the [[Vault of Tomes]] might be through the Undercroft of [[Neverwinter Castle]] where a tunnel system had been built prior to the eruption of [[Mt Hotenow]] in the event of such catastrophes where the invaluable lore from the [[Vault of Tomes]] could be transported quickly to the castle for temporary safekeeping.

As he spoke with her, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] was moved to compassion for the Loremaster, knowing her story and seeing her current condition. He offered to take her hand and see if he could help alleviate her pain directly. As she reluctantly offered her hand, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] cast a Greater Restoration spell, knowing the possible implications of using magic. The spell began to remove [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]]'s condition as her skin changed from white and clammy to what appeared to be its original brown color and long black well-groomed hair. [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] thanked [[Asad Al-Nuri]], seeming to have trouble understanding his motivations. She also told [[Asad Al-Nuri]] that the lore he had offered to her from [[Kerruma]] would be forever safe, as would anything else he would like to provide to the [[Vault of Tomes]] for safekeeping. [[Asad Al-Nuri]]  then exited the entrance area up the the library proper where [[Damien]] was waiting for him, eagerly seeking to know what happened. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] informed [[Damien]] about Loremaster's condition and how he had used magic to help her. Hearing this, [[Damien]]'s face fell and seemed to be paralyzingly conflicted the remainder of their journey back to [[The Moonstone Mask]].

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] finished their shopping and also made their way back to [[The Moonstone Mask]].

[[Gerard Vos]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] remained in [[The Moonstone Mask]] during the day. [[Gerard Vos]] briefly met with [[Brandt]] who told him he had discovered that the [[Phylund Northern Rail Line]] train to [[Luskan]] on Sunday would be secretly carrying two [[Thayan]] prisoners to a "black site" of sorts the [[Everwatch Knights]] have somewhere in the city. 

You all then shared the knowledge you had gained throughout the day, realizing there are three main tasks in front of you as options moving forward--traveling to [[Luskan]] to frame [[Jeremiah Phylund]] for some of the catastrophic events at [[Vos Industries]], possibly recovering one of the [[Sirin Beacons]] in the [[Vault of Tomes]], and a job [[Sighi Thorgison]] has offered to give [[Teymir]] in exchange for an expensive cloak in [[The Northern Exchange]]. 

You all are now congregate in one of the rooms of [[The Moonstone Mask]] where you have just completed sharing what you've discovered throughout the day.

And that's where we pick up. It's approaching dinner time, around 6pm on Friday. What do you do?

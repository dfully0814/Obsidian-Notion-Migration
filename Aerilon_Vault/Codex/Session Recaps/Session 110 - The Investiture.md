# Last we left off...

You began as your small group began to settle into the entrance chamber of a cave for the evening to rest after the brutal frost giant ambush. After speaking with [[Ethes Grahlund]] and discovering [[Ethes Grahlund]] had financed some of the logistics that lead to the ambush of the [[Phylund Lightning Rail]] train, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] made his way back over to the rest of the party, who were sitting around one of the two campfires that [[Thryn]] built in the entrance chamber of the cave.

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] shared with the rest of the party what [[Ethes Grahlund]] had told him. Soon afterward, [[Murlough Grahlund]], the robotic figure who later introduced himself as [[Professor Klaren Ray]], and [[Thryn]] came over and sat down among you. You began to talk with them regarding what they knew about the train ambush. [[Murlough Grahlund]] shared that they had been working in the far reaches of the north near a group of settlements known as [[Ironhaven]], and that they had been working with an agent of the [[Harpers]] who was investigating [[Thayan]] activity near a major frost giant stronghold called [[Svardborg]], who he said was formerly lead by an individual known as [[Jarl Storvald]]. He told you that they discovered that [[Sadia Amos]] brokered an alliance with [[Jarl Storvald]] and the frost giants by acquiring a rare dragon from a smuggler in the far east of [[Aerilon]] known as [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] who leads a mercenary company in the [[Nether Mountains]]. He shared that he didn't know how [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] managed to apprehend such a creature without it immediately and utterly destroying him, and that it was this thread that they were planning to pursue next.

[[Teymir]] immediately spoke and said that your group had crossed paths with [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] in [[Baraskur]], and that it was a group of robed individuals wearing dragon masks who seemed to control the creature somehow. [[Professor Klaren Ray]] then magically conjured a white dragon mask in his hand and asked you if the masked resembled the one in his hand. Once [[Teymir]] affirmed that it did, he asked [[Professor Klaren Ray]] where he found the mask. [[Professor Klaren Ray]] said that he found the mask in a small abandoned hamlet in [[Ironhaven]] called [[Good Mead]] and that it seemed to have a presence around it that reached into him when he once put it on, and he has kept it safely hidden ever since. [[Teymir]] asked [[Murlough Grahlund]] if he had heard of a group known as the [[Wyrmspeakers]]. After hearing that [[Murlough Grahlund]] and his group had only heard mythological rumblings of such a group in the North, [[Teymir]] affirmed that they seem to be real and that this brokerage of the dragon has something to do with them.

[[Teymir]] also shared that this dragon spoke with your group and introduced himself as [[Arharzel]], who seemed particularly interested in a former party member who followed an entity called [[Auril]], who [[Murlough Grahlund]] certainly had heard of, sharing with you that many fanatical groups of people follow her like a patron saint in the north, believing a recent phenomena of total darkness 24 hours a day to be judgment from her upon the people of [[Ironhaven]], and the people have turned to many shocking and drastic measures to appease her. [[Teymir]] continued by sharing that this [[Arharzel]] not only had introduced himself and spoken with your party but that this creature later killed the same member of your party when [[Arharzel]] confronted him and helping her and this party member had basically spit in [[Arharzel]]'s face. 

[[Ethes Grahlund]] then walked over with a grief-stricken look on his face, placed a hand on [[Murlough Grahlund]]'s shoulder, and introduced himself and told [[Murlough Grahlund]] that he is his nephew, son of [[Alas Grahlund]]--the eldest son of the Grahlund family--and that [[Alas Grahlund]] had been recently assassinated by [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]. He shared that [[Alas Grahlund]], knowing imminent danger was coming to the [[House Grahlund]] family, had sent [[Ethes Grahlund]] to find [[Murlough Grahlund]] and his other brothers to see if they were safe. He said he had gone to great expense to find [[Murlough Grahlund]] but never knew he was on the train or that he would discover him like this. He shared with your group that he had brokered a deal with a member of the [[Valkurians]] in [[Waterdeep]] to get information on the whereabouts of a notable member of [[House Cassalanter]], the family archivist named [[Vincent Cassalanter]], who he planned to assassinate in retaliation for [[Alas Grahlund]] as well as use the journal [[Vincent Cassalanter]] often carried on him to discover [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]'s whereabouts. 

[[Teymir]] asked what the individual looked like whom he brokered this deal with. After describing him, [[Teymir]] recognized him as [[Sam Lee]], a good friend of his from the [[Waterdeep]] cell who lived in the [[Dock Ward]] close to [[Teymir]]. [[Teymir]] pieced together that [[Sam Lee]] is not high up enough in the [[Valkurians]] to broker this kind of contract on his own and was likely sent by the [[Harbormaster]] to maintain anonymity. He also knowns that [[Sighi Thorgison]] has not been the [[Harbormaster]] of [[Waterdeep]] for several months, and that someone else must have been put in [[Sighi Thorgison]]'s place who approved this contract. 

[[Ethes Grahlund]], who appeared to all of you to be around 18 years old, lamented that he had obviously been tricked since the assassination attempt had utterly failed and someone had much greater aspirations for this train ambush, likely discovering through this deal that [[Sadia Amos]] would be aboard this train. He also shared that since now he doesn't even know if [[Vincent Cassalanter]] died in this ambush or not since he didn't have time to check the battlefield. As he tried to take it all in, [[Murlough Grahlund]] told the young man that it was nice to meet him, and he was clearly filled with anger over [[Alas Grahlund]]'s death. [[Teymir]] shared that your group likely would disagree in a lot with [[Ethes Grahlund]] and his family, but one thing you can all agree on is that you would like to see [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] dead. [[Teymir]] then shared some about your past interactions with [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] as well.

With all of the evidence before him, [[Murlough Grahlund]] acknowledge that for some reason your party and his family seem to be on the same path--to what end he doesn't know. He then asked you what your plans were, when [[Teymir]] shared some about the investigation into [[Vos Industries]] which he then turned over to [[Gerard Vos]] to explain more, who over the course of the entire conversation had been gazing glassy-eyed into the fire clearly dissociated from everything around him.

After taking a few attempts to get [[Gerard Vos]]'s attention, [[Teymir]] turned the conversation over to him when [[Murlough Grahlund]] shared that he could tell [[Gerard Vos]] was a former soldier when they first met on the train. They shared some with one another about their experiences with war, when [[Gerard Vos]] then told him about your purposes in [[Luskan]], about [[Arthund Jamas]] and the investigation, and [[Murlough Grahlund]] concluded it would be valuable to come and help and maybe discover more on [[Sadia Amos]]'s whereabouts and the [[Wyrmspeakers]]. He asked [[Professor Klaren Ray]] to return to [[Ironhaven]] to see to his youngest brother who he referred to as "Demus".

You then began to prepare to sleep as you planned your night watches in the cave chamber, noticing each of the three [[Everwatch Knights]] had planned their own watches in parallel to your party. [[Gerard Vos]] began the first watch with [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]], as they also discussed some of their experience with war and the long-term effects on a person when you take someone's life. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] then took his watch with younger male knight who introduced himself as [[Guardian Edward Jaxon]], the younger brother of [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]]. He told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] he had convinced [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] to enlist in the first place by enlisting first and knowing she likely wouldn't allow him to go on his own. He shared that this was his first major battle as he had mostly been garrisoned in the major cities, [[Waterdeep]] as of late. He was clearly shaken up and in a state of shock as he talked to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]. He told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] that there hasn't been a formal conscription to the knights in over two decades as the last several decades have been free of any major conflicts other than border skirmishes with [[Thay]]. Also, the knights haven't needed to force conscription since so many people in [[Aerilon]] seem to be willing to enlist voluntarily.

He also mentioned to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] that [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] likely wouldn't see the morning. He explained that the knights have a foundational belief that any knights would die in battle are taken to [[Helm]]'s side at the [[Divine Gate]] to forever aid in guarding the world from what lies beyond. This the greatest of honors for a knight to die in this way. However, if a [[Protectorate]] perishes in a battle and its leader doesn't, the leader's men will go to [[Helm]]'s side without a leader to guide them and the men will be dishonored unless their leader accompanies them. Therefore, captains or commanders will perform a ritual called [[The Investiture]] and explained the purposes of the ceremony to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]. 

[[Teymir]]'s watch then began with [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]]. Before any words were exchanged between them, [[Teymir]] watched the commander stepped just outside the cave entrance and began taking off each piece of his plate armor in an organized and orderly fashion, place each piece in what appeared to be strategically placed spots on the ground. [[Teymir]] then watched the commander lift his large greatsword and extend the hilt to the sky and begun to pray in a low volume under his breath. The commander then stood and planted the hilt of the sword in the ground with the large blade pointed up as the hilt began to glow. Realizing what was happening [[Teymir]] stepped over and began talking to the commander to try and understand what he was doing and why. [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] explained what he was doing and why.

[[Teymir]] then began to try and convince him to see to it that his remaining soldiers made it to safety first. He told the commander that he has been trying to understand better the knight's purpose and that a god who would require abandoning his soldiers is not one he would want to follow. He also complimented the commander multiple times on his bravery and effectiveness with the battle with the frost giants. [[Teymir]] eventually managed to convince the commander to delay [[The Investiture]] until the party made it successfully to [[Luskan]]. [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] agreed and said that he would ensure they got there safely but he would not enter the city, as it would be shameful and dishonorable. [[Teymir]] affirmed that decision would both honor his men to a greater degree and he has certainly gained respect with [[Teymir]] with the decision.

And that's where we pick up....

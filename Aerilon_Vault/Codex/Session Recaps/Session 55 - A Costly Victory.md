# Last we left off...
The battle between the [[Dawn Chaser]] and [[Fortunate Son]] continued to rage in the midst of a torrential storm at sea near a mysterious island in the [[Whalebone Islands]]. As [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] crew fought alongside [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]] to attempt to begin boarding the Fortunate Son, a series of lightning arrows shot from the crow's nest of the Fortunate Son, catching Robinson unaware and quickly sending him plummeting from the rigging of the Dawn Chaser. Safely navigating through the whirlpool in the middle of the upper deck, [[Timbre]] managed to hover over Robinson, raise him up out of the water and bring him back to consciousness, performing the same feat with Yang sometime later.

Yang fought face to face with a robed figure from the Fortunate Son who managed to teleport across a bolt of lightning to the Dawn Chaser and seemed to fight in somewhat the same martial art style as Yang. After several successful stuns, Yang had the robed figure on her heels, eventually being finished by Moonlight's first mate, [[Gregor]].

[[Barbara]] managed to make his way onboard the Fortunate Son as he was assailed both from the [[Everwatchers]] clothed figure and other members of [[Captain Riffolk Salte]]s crew on deck as well as the same devastating lightning arrows from the crow's nest. He managed to fend them off and jumped over the side of the ship and into one of the open port holes on the side of the ship. As he entered the second deck, he saw a group of Salt's crew manning the cannons on that deck as well as Captain Salt and [[Aiden Zatchet]] as they were making their way back onto the top deck. Pushing past them, Barbara attempted to light a cask of gunpowder at the front of the ship to sink it. However, Captain Salt managed to render Barbara unconscious and put out the flame to the gunpowder by conjuring a large wave that he sent hurling into Barbara.

Salt then knelt over Barbara's unconscious body, placing his scaly hand on Barbara's face and raised him back to consciousness as a similarly barnacled pale green figure in his employ and service. Barbara knew immediately that his continued existence now depended upon his faithful service to Salt.

Zatchet, Salt, and the unknown Triton figure in the crow's nest managed to escape the ship as they began to see the rest of the crew succumbing to Moonlight's crew. The Triton and Captain Salt managed to begin swimming at supernatural speeds in the water to the island 150ft. east of the Fortunate Ship, likely helping Zatchet who they seemed to want to continue protecting for an unknown reason.

You began searching the bottom deck of the Fortunate Son where you found a series of cells containing malnourished and gaunt looking people who told you they were slaves having been taken from the coastline near Thornhold and enroute to areas unknown. You also met an individual shackled in a single cell named [[Benjamin Cornwallis]], who seemed to be mentally fractured. He noticed his hands were longer than normal human hands should be and that he also had a layer of leathery skin the same color as normal skin. He continually muttered and repeated the phrase, "[[The Beginning is Ending]]" and also kept muttering "They did things to meâ€¦". He also seemed to know Robinson and Yang's name. At the conclusion of your interaction, Yang decided to plunge a dagger into his chest. Yang watched as thick black liquid began pouring out of his chest and onto the ground where a small green fungus began growing up through the wood slats of the deck.

Yang then began speaking to the other slaves and telling them he hadn't yet decided what to do with them depending on their usefulness.

And that's where we pick up. Zatchet, Salt, and a Triton marksman have likely made their way to the island near you and are pursuing unknown ends. You currently have acquired control of the Fortunate Son with a small group of slaves on board. Yang has discovered a crystal gem with a mote of blue light in the middle that seems to be a similar recording gem like you found in the underground temple. Yang has also left the head of the man dressed in Everwatcher garb on the top deck.

What do you do?

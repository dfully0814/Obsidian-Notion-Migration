# Last we left off...
Your battle in [[Baraskur]] continued to rage as fire mingled with ice, blood with steel, and death with life. As [[Teymir]] awoke inside of the mechanical armor, groggy and burning, he tumbled out of the armor onto the icy stone ground.

Meanwhile, as [[Robinson Fellweather]] continued pulling [[Ugrug]] behind him, Ugrug began carving into his own body with his large sword sending a wave of necrotic energy into Robinson's body, knocking him unconscious and off of his boar to the ground, bringing Ugrug down to his feet near Robinson. Ugrug managed to then disappear from sight and break the tether with Robinson, leaving him lying unconscious and making his way to the yellow obelisk, eventually infusing himself and the other [[Hobgoblins]] with fire abilities.

Bringing one of her undead minions controlled by the green obelisk, [[Elleanna Corvus]] discovered that she could continually summon more undead flying creatures as a subsequent undead creature concentrating on the obelisk. She successfully performed this twice, using the undead to surround the large fire creature who had fled to escape [[Arharzel]]'s blizzard and destroy it with blast after blast of necrotic orbs.

With almost lifeless bodies dropping to the ground and necrotic explosions, [[Yang Tieh]] knelt in the presence of Arharzel and the torrential blizzard surrounding him. Cautiously looking up, Yang could only see the crystal cerulean blue of Arharzel's eyes as he heard a slow, old, and penetrating voice say in a somewhat inquisitive tone, "You are touched by [[Auril]]. Why are you here?" Yang remembered from his past studies that Auril is an entity in the history of [[Aerilon]] and beyond who is know by many different names frequently with various legends and myths associated to it. In Yang's culture, Auril is known as [[Suijin]], the benevolent goddess of water including precipitation such as snow and rainfall. He remembered the name _Auril_ being connected to this same entity but being viewed as more of a mythological patron saint of the [[Uncharted North]] in the Aerilon empire, often appealed to by travelers braving the hazardous, desolate, and mysterious lands of the North. Arharzel also mentioned to Yang that if Auril touched him that must mean there is a conflict coming. He concluded by mentioning to Yang that he is only in Baraksur because he wants to be.

At this point, a masked robed figure walked through the large portal on the top tier of the arena, holding its hand up in Arharzel's direction and chanting. Arharzel began to respond violently, wrenching his head back at forth as the figure continued chanting and walking closer in his direction. At this point, the party began turning all major offensive damage onto the figure as Yang fired a concussive blast from the red obelisk, Teymir (now successfully controlling the mechanical armor) firing another explosive concussive blast from a cannon on the hand of the armor, and Robinson hurling a searing ball of fire. Ducking and dodging the best he could, the figure seemed intent to focus on Arharzel eventually leading to Yang coming through the portal behind him, surprising him, and getting the final killing blow with a well-targeted jab into his temple, sending trickling blood out his ears and down his neck before collapsing limply onto the ground.

Arharzel, seemingly in control of himself once again then flew up and perched onto the ceiling of the arena firing blasts of freezing energy into the ceiling and creating long sharp ice shards inside of the ceiling while Ell began to focus all of the undead attacks on necrotic orbs onto the ceiling as well, causing necrotic energy to spread through the shards.

However, before further attacks on the ceiling could be made, Robinson looked on from the cliff side across from the middle of the arena as his tethered nemesis Ugrug, the final living brother of Insk, stood over Yang's unconscious body. Seizing the opportune moment, he lobbed a whizzing ball of lightning at Ugrug from across the gap of lava below, fatally electrocuting him and sending him to the ground a smoking and charred husk.

The moment Ugrug took his last breath, all obelisks in the arena lost their power, ice began to quickly spread and cover the lava bed, and ten masked robed figures entered the arena with arms extended and chanting in Arharzel's direction. Suddenly docile, Arharzel backed down off of the ceiling to the upper tier below, wings folded back and sat on his hind legs breathing heavily as Blazbaard and Klovag entered the arena through the portal escorted by 5 winged white-skinned [[Draconic]] creatures as Yang and Teymir having just awoken from unconsciousness and John Smith very recently awaking from unconsciousness., all succumbing to wounds inflicted by a mixture of fire, ice, and steel.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

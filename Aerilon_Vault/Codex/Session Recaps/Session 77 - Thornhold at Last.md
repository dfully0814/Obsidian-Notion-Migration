# Last we left off...
You continued in the underwater vessel from The [[Paramount]], continuing in the direction of [[Thornhold]] as a mysterious sea creature maintained a firm grip on your vessel with its tentacles. Azure continued bargaining with the creature, telling it that it would find many more vessels at your destination than the single vessel it could take from you. When you arrived 1 mile offshore of Thornhold’s location, the SONAR of your vessel detected about 25 blips on the surface. The creature immediately detached itself from your vessel, ascended to the surface, and you began to hear the sounds of cannon fire and other explosions as a battle seemingly ensued between a fleet of ships and the creature.

You asked [[Lyra]] to continue piloting the vessel forward until she was sure you had passed the conflict above before surfacing. Detecting that you had safely passed the conflict, Lyra began to surface the vessel and you opened the hatch to see a cloudy, dark, and gray sky with ash raining down from it onto your face and clothing, covering large sections of the shoreline ahead of you. You saw a large citadel in the distance built into the cliff face with tall spires seeming to reach into the heavens like gaunt arms. The citadel had a bright green circle around it that was thrumming with energy and power.

You approached the shore in the vessel and disembarked from the vessel when [[Yang Tieh]] encountered a half-elven figure with dark gray skin and scars covering the entirety of his body. As Yang crept behind him and placed a dagger to his throat, the half-elf seemed to lean into the dagger and slowly slice his neck with a sigh of relief. The half-elf told Yang that the citadel in the distance belonged to [[House Xorlarrin]] and that they “owned everything.” The half-elf didn’t seem to have ever heard of the city of Thornhold or any of the places that Yang referenced to him. Deciding he would be of little use, Yang cut the half-elf’s throat and dropped him into the shallow ocean water near him. After a few moments, the half-elf became animated once again exhibiting sharp, rapid, and hungry movements in its body. It then proceeded to run up into a cluster of fishing shacks you had previously seen and began attacking the other inhabitants of those shacks, causing the same transformation in them as they fell. You all avoided detection by any of these creatures up to this point as the 15 or so creatures seem to continue congregating around the shacks as you looked on.

Yang and [[Azure Flint]] then made their way to what they later learned was an [[Everwatch Knights]] camp city near the base of the mountainside into which the large citadel was built. Yang managed to see a light silver shimmer surrounding the camp, remembering it to be a similar anti-magic field he saw surrounding some of the [[Everwatchers]] flying vessels on the island in the [[Whalebone Islands]]. He watched as the hulking figure of [[Captain Roland Royston]] exited the tent, flanked by two mages of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] as they made their way to the opposite end of the camp.

Yang and Azure then watched as a large orange sphere, about 50ft in diameter raised up into the air, sparking and crackling with energy and was soon followed by two blue-robed members of the Arcane Brotherhood all meeting 40ft in the air. The two mages then fired large bolts of orange energy into the sphere, causing the sphere to then fire much larger bolts of energy out of the other side and into the thrumming green circle surrounding the citadel, causing the width of the circle to narrow as they appeared to continue channeling energy into the orange sphere.

Meanwhile, Yang asked Azure to go back to the rest of the party as Yang ran into the camp, watching as his invisibility from [[Elleanna Corvus]] was brought down by the anti-magic field. He eventually met with Captain Royston, telling him that he and your party had come to offer assistance to save Thornhold. Though Captain Royston was cautious at first to trust Yang, his temperament seemed to quickly change when Yang mentioned Thornhold and specifically mentioned that it was the city he was from. Royston then agreed to accept Yang’s help, seeing many of his soldiers being brought into the camp in droves either dead or with critical injuries.

Royston then told Yang he had to leave his spear in the camp and asked Yang to bring the rest of his group to the camp and meet with [[Lady Liane Antiet]], [[Archmage of Domestic Protections]].

And that’s where we pick up...

# Last we left off...

After [[Teymir]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] briefly discussed [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s ability he had just displayed in capturing some sort of essence form the half-orc leader into a trinket of his, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] explained that they would be able to ask the spirit of the half-orc one question if they broke the trinket. After thinking for a while, [[Teymir]] broke the trinket and asked, "Who is trying to kill me?" A disembodied voice responded, "[[High Protector Anamanue Silverhand]]", who [[Teymir]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] both know to be the empress of the empire of [[Aerilon]]. 

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] talked some with [[Elleanna Corvus]] telling her that he hopes in her and that the bracelet he gave her was given by his mother with hope that his journey was right when he answered the call of his friend [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]. He then told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that he doesn't misplace his hope and [[Elleanna Corvus]] responded that she doesn't deserve a gift like this and that he likely will regret hoping in her.

You finished your time in the valley camp and set out the next day, traversing through more mountainous crags leading up out of the valley and overlooking picturesque blue waterfalls. Your party came upon a small, idyllic but run down and dilapidated hunting shack at the base of a large waterfall in the background. [[Elleanna Corvus]] suddenly caught the smell of a smoldering fire on the wind as she then recognized this cabin as one that [[Tanavast Adamantus]] had taken her when he was granted leave from the [[Neverwinter]] garrison. She later told [[Teymir]] and [[Gerard Vos]] that this was a place her father would retreat to when having particular acute wrestlings with his addiction to [[Dragon Amber]], which [[Elleanna Corvus]] shared for the first time is something that many knights endure, particularly those with long-term consumption of it. [[Elleanna Corvus]] shared this to be the place that her father could treat her like a normal person, abilities and all. She sat in the middle of the cabin and cast an illusion over the entire structure, making it look as she always remembered it. When [[Teymir]] noticed what she was doing, seemingly oblivious to the knights just outside, he quickly managed to talk her into removing the illusion before anyone saw. [[Teymir]] tried to comfort [[Elleanna Corvus]] by putting his arm around her and telling her, " "I know what it's like to cling to a memory."

After spending a few more moments alone, [[Elleanna Corvus]] rejoined the group and you continued forward until dusk when [[Thryn]] recommended you make camp.

You then began your watches where [[Elleanna Corvus]] once again conversed with [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]], who appeared particularly pensive this evening. He told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that after talking to [[Thryn]] it seems you are about half way to [[Luskan]] and that it won't be much longer until he will perform [[The Investiture]], so he has begun to prepare his heart and his mind. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then told [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] about her father and what happened to him. She told him about [[Tanavast Adamantus]]'s addiction and how that had affected their family growing up. [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] responded by apologizing for all she had endured and said many families across [[Aerilon]] have made a similar sacrifice to ensure the safety of [[Aerilon]]'s people. You then told [[Elleanna Corvus]] that many people are likely alive today because of the sacrifices her father has made. He also told her that he would look for [[Tanavast Adamantus]] when he reaches [[Helm]]'s side and maybe he could be much more help there than here. He also shared with [[Elleanna Corvus]] that he would leave a family behind, but they understood the sacrifice that might be required of him one day. 

[[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] then asked [[Elleanna Corvus]] if he could be alone to finish out the last watch of the evening.

And that's where we pick up on the morning of your third day of travel....

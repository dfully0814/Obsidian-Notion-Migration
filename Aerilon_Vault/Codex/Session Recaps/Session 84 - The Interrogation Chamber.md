#recap 
# Last we left off...
In the underground caverns beneath the [[House Xorlarrin Citadel]], you all heard [[Teymir]] yell, "she can see us," as he frantically pulled a broken and beaten man from an indention in the wall he had just created for a few moments. You all turned to see a female figure standing before you wearing a white-tusked headdress and covered in tribal tattoos, bearing a long staff seemingly made of shadow with a green orb at the top. 

Being able to see through [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s illusion she had created that made each of you look like [[House Xorlarrin]] guards, she immediately attacked you, accompanied by a number of formless shadows which she began drawing power from periodically throughout your encounter with her. She also seemed to possess the ability to call shadowed tentacles up from the ground that lashed and grabbed at you throughout the cavern. 

At one point early in the fight, after drawing a large amount of power from the shadows, she released a scream throughout the cavern, knocking [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] unconscious and damaging the rest of you.

[[Yang Tieh]] noticed a [[Drow]] female chained to a wall opposite the cave entrance and decided to free her and hand her an axe. She immediately began attacking the Drow priestess as well as a large hulking and red-eyed beast with four arms and long white hair which also entered into the fight to support the priestess.

You eventually managed to defeat this female figure after a final well-placed shot from [[Gerard Vos]] after she left many of you reeling and barely standing.

As you all gathered yourselves, you saw a patrol of guards, mage, and arachnid creature making their way to your location after hearing the sounds from the priestess echoing through the chambers.

And that's where we pick up...

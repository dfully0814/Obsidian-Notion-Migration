# Last we left off...
You began in a system of caves on the outskirts of the [[Mere of Dead Men]] at a campsite with a [[Thayan]] Half-Elf [[Drow]] named [[Cassius Cromwell]], his wife [[Raene Cromwell]], and infant son [[Caleb Cromwell]]. You continued asking him questions about Thayan culture, the origins and nature of the conflict between the Watcher and Thayan empires, and experimenting with him with the mysterious orange stones you have encountered throughout your journey.

You learned from him that it was a group of Drow people who initially established the nation of Thay sometime during the end of the [[Calamity]] and the beginnings of the [[Post Divergence]]. You learned that at some point during its history when the nation was at the height of its power, a civil war began within the council of 8 Thayan [[Zulkirs]] (governing archmages) that was instigated by the Archmage of Necromancy, [[Telamont Tanthul]]. You learned it's believed the war began over sharp disagreements regarding methods for territory expansion and magical practice between Tanthul and the Zulkir of Transmutation, [[Alina Baenre]] of Drow [[House Baenre]], who is credited as being the initial founder of the small nation of people who would eventually become the empire of [[Thay]]. The war was known as the [[War of Eight]].

You learned that Tanthul and his followers lost the war after significant losses on both sides, including several of the original [[Zulkirs]], including [[Alina Baenre]]. He was then exiled across the sea to West [[Aerilon]] where he went on to eventually found the Magocracy of [[Netheril Empire]] in order to pursue magical studies and expansion the way he saw fit.

[[Cassius Cromwell]] also told you that he believes the current open war between your two empires is due to the Watchers possessing artifacts that are highly prized and sacred to the Thayans, metallic devices with powerful energy sources cut and molded into precise geometric shapes, which you recognized as likely being the same as the [[Sirin Beacons]]s Ell learned about from the [[The Guide]].

You then showed him the mysterious orange stones in your possession as well as the black liquid Yang carries in a vial in his backpack. Yang poured a small drop of the black liquid onto the orange stone and watched as the stone seemed to absorb the liquid and become slightly larger. Cassius then ingested the stone and you all watched as he seemed to temporarily display supernatural strength and accuracy until his body seemed to begin to reject the foreign element inside him as he began writhing in pain. You learned that it seems the [[Everwatch Knights]] might likely be ingesting these stones, having found a small pouch of them on [[Captain William Acox]] and piecing together effects you also saw in his body.

Afraid of the effects that might be caused from this black liquid, [[Elleanna Corvus]] ran off deeper into the caves, and [[Teymir]] soon followed to find her when he heard a loud scream. He quickly traced the source to a small antechamber where he saw Ell standing with a horrified look on her face and the crumpled body of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] at her feet.

After investigating his body, Teymir and Yang both concluded that he had likely been attacked and executed from behind, seeing his throat had been sliced open with a blade. They also concluded from the dried blood and coldness of his body that he had likely been dead for a few weeks. They also noticed that his clothing had been ripped and tattered, along with cuts and bruises on his face and hands that seemed to be older than the gash across his throat. Yang lastly noticed that there seemed to be a disparate freshness to his eyes, not appearing milky like he would expect for someone dead for weeks.

In response to Ell's scream, a horde of shadowed humanoid figures began to converge on the center of the cave from the east and west as you all sprinted back into Cassius' camp and collapsed the opening. As you fought off two figures that made it into the camp, you noticed them to be at a stage between the zombie-like gray figures you saw in the underground temple and [[Westwood Forest]] and the fully shadowed figures you faced down with Cassius near the caves. From that, you learned the [[Darkweave]] seems to advance in stages once it overtakes an organic form.

You then began preparations for facing off the Retriever that is currently hunting Cassius and his family.

And that's where we pick up...

#recap 
# Last we left off...
You began as [[Elleanna Corvus]] heard the blast of [[Teymir]]'s laser pistol from outside the mining cave as Teymir shot [[Captain William Acox]] through the head. As she ran into the cave to attempt to figure out what had happened, [[Yang Tieh]] initially blocked her from moving too far into the room, telling her that they should let [[Azure Flint]] and Teymir work it out since this is something they started. Ell began a series of confrontations with Teymir both in and outside the cave, imploring him and asking him what he did and why. Teymir responded by saying "I did what I had to." Ell questioned whether Captain Acox was even a threat as he had been cemented into the ground as he was. Grieved over having killed the captain, Teymir told Ell that he would've just left the captain at the wall and never brought him in the first place. He challenged Ell and asked if leaving him in the ground to starve to death instead while the party quietly left would've been better. He also challenged her regarding her killing of [[Klovag]] and said that she did that because that's what she thought was best for the party and she had no other option. He repeatedly told Ell that he and Azure both did everything they could, but once the captain saw Teymir's display of magic he became a dangerous threat to the group, in spite of how much Teymir wanted the captain to not be like all the others. He told Ell that it's because of [[Tanavast Adamantus]] that he maintains hope that not all the knights are the same.

In return, Ell told Teymir that he and Azure should've tried harder and found a better way. She told him that he should've just let Azure do it since it was his plan and seemed genuinely broken at the thought of Teymir having gone to a place she didn't expect that he would be willing to go.

As Ell and Teymir both ventured out of the cave during this confrontation, Yang sat alone in the cave playing his flute and happened to notice that the captain's head had slumped in the opposite direction that it was originally hanging. Walking over and investigating the body, he noticed familiar black veins running up the captain's neck into his jaw, and he also noticed an orange tint to the whites of the captain's eyes. Yang quickly grabbed his spear and severed the captainâ€™s head from his body, noticing now that the orange in his eyes became gradually more pronounced but the black veins had ceased to spread. Yang recalled not seeing these effects in the captain as you traveled and began to wonder if the manifestation of them now had something to do with the fight or flight response that would have inevitably kicked in when the captain saw Teymir cast magic.

Your group then slept the night in the cave noticing an unnatural increase in temperature and humidity around you in the cave, going up to somewhere around 90 degrees but you didn't detect any threats so you decided to sleep. You all awoke the next morning, and set out in the direction of the city of [[Leilon]]. You traveled the majority of the day, and around dusk you all experienced similar unnaturally high temperatures for the winter as you continued traveling outside near the [[Sword Mountains]]. You decided to make camp for the night somewhere in the lower crags of the mountains.

Ell ventured out from the group in search for a protected campsite when she soon noticed the body of a deer that had bee dismembered and decapitated and seemed to have been drug along the ground and half-eaten. She also saw the large paw and hooved prints you had previously seen in the devastated battlefield full of dead Everwatch Knights 5 days northeast of you where you encountered the disembodied form of [[Tanavast Adamantus]]. Believing that this creature was somehow related to her father, [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to track the footprints further up the mountain without letting the rest of the group know. Seeing that she wasn't coming back [[Teymir]] began to follow 1500 or so feet behind her as he went up. Ell began to see increasing numbers of frozen bodies laid out along the mountain path in a somewhat organized fashion. She continued following the path of bodies as they continued to increase in number until she came to a left turn where on the path that curved around 90 degrees out of her current site line. She cautiously approached the turn, peered out, and was surprised to see that the path of bodies suddenly stopped and no further blood trail could be seen also.

Above her, she suddenly heard what sounded like two large branches cracking in quick succession and large stones begin to fall from the cliff-side as though a large form was pressing against the cliff-side above. She immediately turned and began running in the way that she had come as she heard the piercing sound of a lion's roar that seemed to penetrate her mind with paralyzing fear, which she managed to avoid. However, as [[Teymir]] frantically began running up the mountain steppes to her aid he also heard the roar, failing to resist it, and found himself doubled over paralyzed with fear on the freezing mountain ground. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then looked over her shoulder as she ran to see a humongous creature with all black skin, massive wings with a red tint underneath, four glowing hot haunches and three heads (dragon, lion, goat) begin to dissolve seemingly out of thin air and swoop down upon her. The dragon head open its gaping maw and drug its razor teeth down her back, wracking her with an intense burning pain.

Realizing that the creature was upon her, she thunder stepped 90 ft off the mountains ledge intending to quickly plummet down to escape the creature. With a quick reflex, the creature turned in her direction as she saw the eyes and mouth of the dragon's black head began to flare and then exhume a white hot stream of molten fire in her direction out and off the ledge, engulfing her in the flames and knocking her unconscious.

Meanwhile, Teymir struggled to break through the paralyzing influence of the creature and happened to pull himself out of it just as Ell began plummeting unconscious 2500ft to the ground. He managed to heal her, bringing her to consciousness, but failed to leap off the ledge where he was poised to dive after her to try and grab her. Ell and Teymir now plummet with increasing speed toward the base of the [[Sword Mountains]], surrounded in a sphere of darkness as the black chimera looks down from above, poised, and ready for a dive.

And what's where we pick up....

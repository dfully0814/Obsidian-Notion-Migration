# Last we left off...
With the smoke clearing from the arena in the cavern city of [[Baraskur]] where you defeated the remaining brothers of [[Insk]], [[Klovag]] and [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] stepped out of the arena's large portal, and Blazbaard began addressing the crowd above you in a booming voice. He referred to an entity known as the [[Great Warrior]] who looks upon the [[Red Flayers]] and the city. He also referred to [[Arharzel]] as a champion of the Great Warrior who would lead the Red Flayers to glorious victory against [[Oknag the Mad]] to avenge their families who have been taken or killed and then help them re-take the [[Doomspire]]. He then mentioned that the Great Warrior had chosen to bestow a boon upon [[Ugrug]] who had protected his brothers in the face of inevitable death and fought on anyway. You then watched as [[Arharzel]] exhaled freezing breath into Ugrug's nose, and [[Yang Tieh]] noticed a few tendriled jellyfish like creatures that seemed to be subsisting in the frost of Arharzel's breath. You looked over the next few minutes as Ugrug's skin became pearl white and he began transforming into the form of the white and winged Draconic creatures you've seen scattered throughout Baraskur. He then instinctively imprinted upon Blazbaard and filed into a circle of the creatures who were protecting him.

[[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] then attempted to communicate to Arharzel in his docile state, discovering that the orange stone didn't seem to have any affect toward him and he didn't seem to be cursed after Ell cast a remove curse spell on him.

On the way back to his home, Klovag addressed Teymir and cynically asked him if he really believed he could do something as fantastical as persuading Arharzel to his side. Klovag then shared that Teymir's apparent naivety and bend toward pursuing something greater gave him hope that he might one day see his family again.

Back in Klovag's home, he began sharing with you the results of his research into the black liquid in Yang's vial. He shared that he had found an unexplainable symbiotic relationship between concentrated and otherworldly negative energy with natural organic matter of the world that you know. He said that there is no reason concentrated negative energy would not simply undo any matter that's organic, including the vial and anyone holding it. He shared that he found a trace of a third synthetic material that could possibly be the material holding the negative energy and organic matter in stasis, allowing the negative energy to subsist on the organic matter without consuming it.

Blazbaard then summoned Teymir as Ell followed invisibly behind. Teymir found Blazbaard's living quarters full of finely made imported goods and furniture, including a finely painted and framed picture of a weather-beaten ship at sea tossed by the waves. Blazbaard, paranoid and inebriated, insisted Teymir tell him who he worked for. Teymir shared your group's desire to help him in the attack on [[Oknag the Mad]], which lead Blazbaard to intently inquire regarding Teymir's motivations for wanting to help. Teymir share his desire to discover elements of his past, which seemed to steer Blazbaard away from asking his motivations further as Blazbaard began to mock him and his choice to risk his own life to discover who he is. Teymir also mentioned a previous working relationship he had with [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] who he assumed Blazbaard would know after seeing the painting of the ship. Blazbaard, many drinks in at this point, mentioned his desire to bring an end to Moonlight and another person he referred to as [[Talir Khan]]. He eventually seemed to agree to let your group aid in the attack on Oknag the Mad. As a condition of your involvement, he asked Teymir to retrieve as many energy cells as possible as it would greatly aid in his future plans.

Blazbaard then told Teymir to kill [[Klovag]] for his failure in his simple task of leading a hunting party. Teymir began beating Klovag unconscious and proceeded to petrify him. Blazbaard then commanded two of his guards to throw the petrified form over the balcony of his living quarters. Ell immediately responded by vaulting over the balcony, teleporting away with Klovag's petrified form and unsuccessfully hiding the destruction of a fake statue in illusion. Blazbaard began to command in vicious tone that you should be found as the white [[Draconic]] creatures began to scatter across the city and a group of flying creatures rushed toward Klovag's home, knowing the rest of your group had been staying with him. Teymir began rushing through the city back to Klovag's home as Ell attempted to signal to [[Rushnaa]] from a shadowed area of the city against the cavern wall where she currently stood over Klovag's form, whose petrified form had begun dissipating.

Two Draconic creatures currently are beating against the door to Klovag's home, and Teymir has made his way down the tunnel a few doors down from the rest of the group.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

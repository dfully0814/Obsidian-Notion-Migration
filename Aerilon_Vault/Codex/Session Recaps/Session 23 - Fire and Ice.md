[[Yang Tieh]] and the party entered a circular room about 35ft. wide in diameter with an equally long metal walkway reaching across. 9 creatures were running down the obsidian stone walls in response to a ravenous call from a 10th creature on the metal walkway after a message spell cast from [[Teymir]]in its direction. Teymir and [[Azure Flint]] immediately sprinted across the walkway to the other side, Azure pushing the creature down and Teymir knock it back toward the rest of the party with several well-placed radiant blasts. As Teymir and Azure entered the stone door opposite the entrance of the room, realizing the danger imposed by the creatures, Teymir sealed the stone door confident that the rest of the party would take care of one another.

Meanwhile, [[John Smith]] and [[Yang Tieh]] began the process of slowly closing the large circular door that contained a large engraving of a tiger's face. As the door neared closing, they both were stunned when [[Tanavast Adamantus]] made the sudden decision to stay behind in the room by himself and face down the creatures. John and Yang backed into the previous room, allowing the circular door to close, ceiling both the room and Tanavast's fate. As Tanavast attempted to face the feral creatures alone, he saw the large mass of bodies in the bit of the room begin to move, as large tentacles began reaching up the obsidian walls, slowly pulling a 10ft wide mass up near the walk way.

As the mass lifted itself up he heard and later saw moaning faces interwoven throughout the body of what looked like a large plant, which began attacking the feral creatures and hungrily consuming some of them and absorbing them into its body. Others, it grabbed and through from the walk way against the wall and into the pit. Overwhelmed by the attacks of both the feral creatures and later the tentacled creature itself, Tanavast succumbed to his wounds and breathed his last as the last flicker of faint light extinguished on his shield and he entered an eternity of darkness, cold, and moaning.

Teymir and [[Azure Flint]] began exploring the large cellar-like room they entered after [[Teymir]] sealed the stone door. They saw several skeletons chained along the periphery of the wall hanging by their wrists, some with elongated hands and feet. In a pile of rubble, Teymir found another transparent gem that contained a recording of a voice much more academic in tone. The recording spoke the words, "Subject 34. Infusion of GP120. Iras' additions may give us favorable results after all. The negative essence in the subject displayed full absorption of physical and arcane trauma for a limited time.

Subsequent volatile release of absorbed trauma later observed. Further refinement required. Telamont will be pleased." They continued out of the cellar room to through a heavy iron door into a dark mahogany hallway. The walls on both sides were arrayed by what appeared to be military and family portraits of half-elven figures dressed in noble attire as well as one older man in particular with black leather armor, long black cape, and a long decorative great sword.

[[Azure Flint]] noticed a ring worn in several of the pictures depicting a large bird looking like a raven, with an elongated shield behind it and a decorative "C" in the top of the shield. He recognized the decorative "C" as belonging to the [[House Cassalanter]] noble family of [[Waterdeep]] who have often done business with the [[Valkurians]]. Teymir and Azure continued moving up and out of the hallway eventually reaching a large dining room where Teymir's face met bright beams of sunlight coming from one side of the room as he saw the other side of the room seem to meld into a bright forested area somewhat similar to the one the party left when you first went underground. To the left and right, he saw a window and outside saw that whatever structure you are in seems to be nestled within the mountainside of a long mountain range, and the range is heavily obscured by a blizzard.

Meanwhile, John and Yang ventured into a secret room in the temple previously discovered by John where Yang triggered and nimbly dodged a deadly wall of fire conjured from a red glyph on the ground as he and John Smith came face to face with another tribal figure that slowly became coming out of a sarcophagus it was buried in. The figure began asking if Yang and John were "help from the Eye" and continually referred to a "rich man" with aggression in his voice. He then slid a metal ring to Yang through the fire that displayed the same family crest Teymir and Azure discovered in the hallway of portraits. Yang seemed to begin to negotiate with him as he knelt down and opened his hands to communicate that he only wanted to help. This is where we pick up. Tanavast is no more. Yang and John continue conversing with this mysterious tribal figure, and Teymire and Azure have seemingly discovered a way out.

#recap 
# Last we left off...

[[Robinson Fellweather]] and [[Yang Tieh]] finished their evening at the wedding celebration gala at the home of [[Alas Grahlund]]. Yang decided to mingle with the crowd after completing his performance with the jazz band and was able to acquire additional information regarding [[Thornhold]]. He discovered that the [[Everwatchers]] are currently planning an assault on Thornhold to liberate it from the underdwelling dark skinned elves who have forcibly taken residence there. He also discovered that the Everwatchers are currently interrogating a dark elf who they have taken into the Requliary in Waterdeep. He was also able to find a noble in Grahlund's family who offered to get a message to Waterdeep for him. Yang told the man to contact a person named "[[Vencer]]" and tell him that he's safe.

[[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] awoke the next morning at their camp they made in the hills of the [[Dessarin Valley]] east of [[Amphail]]. [[Rushnaa]] inititated a conversaiton with Teymir where she apologized for being brash with him previously regarding [[John Smith]]'s death. She also told him she was sorry that he lost a friend and mentioned how tragic it was for the world to lose a brave soldier, especially with how scarce bravery seems to be.

After some deliberation, Teymir and Ell decided to seek out a local horse farm in the valley from which they could acquire riding horses. After some scouting by Rushnaa, they found an idyllic horse farm near the Northfarrow road and were able to successfully acquire two riding horses. While escaping with the horses into the small patch of forest from which they came, they were suddenly assaulted by two half-orcs firing at them from oversized crossbows, knocking both Teymir and Ell off of their horses at various points. They both continued running from the source of the attacks.

Meanwhile, Robinson and Yang began their journey from Alas Grahlund's country estate to the coast where Alas told them they would meet up with a ship crew he is paying to take them out onto the [[Sea of Swords]] and find the [[Fortunate Son]], which he believes [[Aiden Zatchet]] has currently boarded. Alas' cousin [[Hollan Grahlund]], who owns a local fishery on the coast, placed Robinson and Yang in two separate fishery crates in order to safely transport them down the [[Long Road]] to the coast after successfully passing through a couple of [[Everwatch Knights]] checkpoints. Due to his familiarity he has built with the Everwatchers who regularly occupy that road, his wagon was not thoroughly searched.

Once they reached the coast, they met the crew of the [[Dawn Chaser]] led by [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]], who Yang became briefly re-acquainted with. She invited the two onto the ship where they met the rest of the crew again. Moonlight invited them into her office where they met [[Timbre]] and Moonlight began to tell them that she had a separate vested interest in finding the Fortunate Son. She mentioned that she was looking forward to doing good business with the two of them as long as they could stay out of one another's way. She mentioned that she believes the Fortunate Son has currently anchored somewhere near the Whalebone Islands, an archipelago of islands rarely visited due to stories of disappearing ships and other more fantastical myths surrounding the islands. She mentioned that she too has avoided the islands so as not to take any unnecessary risk but now that she has discovered it might lead to finding [[Captain Riffolk Salte]], she would be willing to sail into the abyss itself to find him.

Yang asked Moonlight if she had heard of another captain by the name of [[Talir Khan]]. Moonlight scoffed and referred to his name as one tossed another in legends and ghost stories.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦Yang and Robinson pick up in the captain's quarters of the Dawn Chaser discussing plans with Moonlight for tracking the Fortunate Son and Teymir and Ell are making an escape from an ambush in the woods.

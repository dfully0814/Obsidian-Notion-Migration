# Last we left off...
[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Teymir]] struggled to make their way out of the [[Infirmary]] of The [[Paramount]], fighting against the strong force pulling toward the sensory deprivation chamber where the [[Githzerai]] [[Zera]] rested in what you later learned was a potential state of some kind of mental projection.

As they headed back to the flight deck, Teymir began to hear the sound of a child yelling, smell freshly baked bread, other sounds and smells from memories of his and others he didn’t remember but seemed to create warmth within him like he had experienced before and was experiencing them again. He began to realize over the next hour or so that things weren’t quite right with him beyond seemingly again a few years. He noticed that his senses were incredibly heightened, hearing quiet sounds like they were booming from loudspeakers. He also discovered an exponentially heightened intelligence and wisdom while all other attributes were suppressed by them. He discovered he could solve complex quantum equations, read and retain information at a rapid pace, and perform other feats not natural to him. He discovered that even using magic that had any telepathic or mental component began volatile and dangerous as he attempted a Message spell with both Azure and Ell, both of whom were thrown back against the wall, taking a surge of psychic damage as Teymir attempted to telepathically connect with them. Yang remained behind toward the back of the ship, using his repair gun to weld metal scraps over the Biology Lab door to ensure whatever entities had escaped inside would remain inside.

On the flight deck of the ship, Azure and Ell confronted one another after the escalating confrontation a few moments before. Azure expressed his distaste and lack of trust for Ell in the way she seemed to continually choose to put others in danger for her own ends. He expressed his concern for her selfish ambitions putting Teymir in danger in spite of his ongoing trust in her. Ell responded by angrily asking him why he left her father Tanavast behind to die.

Teymir soon entered the room as the rest of the group got their first glimpses of Teymir’s long beard and aged state, even noticing his clothing to be faded in color and aged as well. Once Teymir communicated some of what had occurred in the Infirmary, he and Azure made their way to the Engineering Lab to record a message to the next person who might find their way on the ship once the party leaves. Teymir began the recording once they arrived at the lab, continually having to focus through the auditory and olfactory stimuli assaulting his senses. In the message, he shared his name, mentioned the Blueshift leak had been repaired, the Biology Lab sealed, that your party had taken one of the distress beacons on the ship, and he mentioned the danger surrounding Zera and the Infirmary.

Accompanied by [[Lyra]], [[Gerard Vos]] then made his way to the ship [[Armory]] for supplies before your party departed the ship. Lyra shared with Vos that he and the party are only cleared to retrieve Mark I-II class small arms from the Armory and that he would not be allowed to enter. Lyra had him stand 50ft back from the Armory door as she engaged in security protocols, and Vos watched the Armory door shuck open, revealing two medium-sized metallic cannons peering down from the ceiling, and two armed robotic figures flanking the back wall before the door quickly closed again behind Lyra. After a few moments, one of the robotic figures exited the Armory behind Lyra leaving a large metallic case just outside the Armory door filled with 4 small arms, and 10 deplorables. Vos took the case back to the flight deck.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]] began looking through the routine medical records stored on the ship for Zera. He noticed in the observational notes that Zera had begun reporting sensory hallucinations early after the storm-like phenomena occurred in the [[Transitory Plane]], reported to you previously by Lyra. It also mentioned a theory Zera had that the malady could be kept at bay by projecting his consciousness outside of his body, leaving his body an empty husk since it seemed the entity attacking his body was focusing on his consciousness.

[[ROMA]] soon provided the ship’s full diagnostics, reporting many of the ship’s systems to be critical. Lyra was also able to triangulate [[Mary Emsworth]]’s most recent location to be near the city of [[Luskan]] to the far north at the border of the empire and the Uncharted North.

You all then made your way to the [[Engineering Lab]] to view Ainsley’s memory device. You watched as a holographic image was projected in VR-like form into the middle of the room as you saw Mary Emsworth and Ainsley sitting across from one another in the camp site. Mary told Ainsley that they never should’ve come to this planet. Ainsley told Mary it was one of many bad options, asking her if she had located [[Damien]] (her brother) and [[Bledda]]’s distress beacons? She said that she located the beacons to the north near [[Luskan]]. Ainsley then told her to travel there and find them as they would need both of them. Ainsley then told her he would remain near the coast a few more days to see if he could locate any more of the crew.

You then fast-forwarded his memory 15 minutes before his death when you saw [[Elleanna Corvus]] frantically burst into his camp, realizing from hearing descriptions of him that this was Captain Ainsley. Ainsley soon picked up from their conversation that she was with Teymir, Yang, and the rest of your group. He urgently told her to take him to your group’s campsite in the caves, telling her that he had urgent information to share with them. You listened as she attempted to persuade him to share the information with her as he obstinately insisted that they go to everyone. She then told Ainsley to begin packing up his stuff and they would go. As he turned around to do so, you saw the fingertips of a hand cover over his face as you heard the sound of cutting into flesh, and Ainsley fell to the ground. As he lay on the ground you saw strange green energy coming up out of his body into Ell, at which point the memory ended as the holographic image went dark.

An escalating confrontation immediately ensued as Azure and Teymir confronted Ell, Vos taking a position of getting everyone off the ship before addressing this but instead getting temporarily pulled into a confrontation with Azure as guns were drawn, Vos and Ell both were paralyzed and tied up and Azure gaining control of Vos’ new plasma shotgun and pistols before replacing them back near his paralyzed and restrained body and telling Vos that he wants to be able to trust him.

Bound and gagged, the party led Ell to the underwater vessel in the cargo bay to depart the ship.

A more intense confrontation began with the party and Ell in the underwater vessel as it detached from the ship and ROMA began autopiloting it on a course for Thornhold. Before removing her gag, Teymir threatened that if she attempted any magic or didn’t give every detail the party would put her down.

Ell began to explain that Galladon had threatened that he would kill the entire party if they became privy to the information that Ainsley had. Therefore, in order to save the party she had to kill Ainsley before he could relay that information to you. Once she finished her explanation and the situation began de-escalating some, Teymir realized with his very high insight, brought about by the unnatural phenomena he encountered in the Infirmary, that Ell had been lying during her whole explanation. He then slammed her up against the wall, flanked by Azure who pointed a gun at her head. A stark coldness then came over Ell as the weeping, frail, and scared girl disappeared--revealing much of that persona to be a masterful subterfuge.

Believing her relationship with Teymir to be at its end and likely her life, the fear in her face seemed to drain as she told Teymir that she killed Ainsley for her and Galladon had nothing to do with it, at which point Teymir looked to Azure and said, “Do whatever you want with her.” Azure then lit his sword with dark green flames, pressing it into Ell’s neck as she willingly offered it to him. He then opened his book, flipping through it and looking for a reason not to kill her. After many consecutive blank pages, he turned to one page showing a sketch of his lost love’s face which he recognized as the look on her face the day he left. After closing the book, he looked down at Ell and said, “Your father was a better friend than you’ll ever be. I owe him this much,” as he removed his flaming sword from her neck, replacing her gag, and sitting down opposite her as necrotic tears began to stream down his face and hiss as they each hit the metal floor beneath him.

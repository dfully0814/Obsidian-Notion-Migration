# Last we left off...
After acquiring horses for [[Azure Flint]] and [[Yang Tieh]] with [[Gerard Vos]]' connections, the party left [[Yartar]] to begin your 11-day or so journey to [[Thornhold]]. On the first day of travel you began to interact with one another regarding your journey ahead. [[Teymir]] and Azure talked together alone for the first time since meeting again during their watch on your first evening of travel. During their watch, Yang and Vos noticed a few strange occurrences--Vos briefly noticing what appeared to be a shadowy form about 50 feet away that seemed to quickly appear and disappear. Yang saw a patch of trees outside the camp whose branches appeared to suddenly bow under the weight of something heavy landing on them and then bowing again as it seemed whatever landed had left.

On your third day of travel, as you began to come down from a series of hills down into the valley where the [[Long Road]] is located, you all saw a large group of hundreds of dead soldiers, all [[Everwatch Knights]] from what you could tell. You also saw long streaks of burned ground and large more spherical areas of burned ground, destroyed worker settlements still smoldering. You saw bodies that have been eviscerated by long piercing and gashes to various degrees as well as some bodies that had appeared to have been cut or run through with swords. As Teymir searched around further, he found large tracks that had been left behind in the snow-covered field each about 10ft wide or so. He was able to find four tracks that appeared to be left by one creature, the front tracks shaped like large paws and the back shaped like large hooves.

As Teymir began making his way back to the group to tell them what he found, [[Elleanna Corvus]] levitated into the air to survey the entire battlefield from a better vantage point. As she began to rise up in the air, she watched as all around her began to dissolve in fits and starts watching as light turned to dark, the bodies across the field disappeared, the city of [[Triboar]] in the distance becoming a much larger city lighted by pale green light, and a dark shadowy figure stood 50ft from the group on horseback as pale green fire came from the horse's eyes and surrounded its hooves. After a few quick dissolves, Ell landed on the ground and watched after one dissolve into this darkness around her that the figure had disappeared while the group simultaneously watched the same figure appear in front of them.

The figure looked across at your group and began to charge in on horseback to attack.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

# **Last we left offâ€¦**

Having come face to face with menacing [[Drow]] figures at the threshold of [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]], [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] began to face off against these two Drow figures as [[Azure Flint]] and [[Teymir]] quickly made their way up the cliffside steps from the dock.

After a brief mishap from one of Teymir's spells, causing him to plummet 40ft into the ocean water below, the party began to converge upon the lighthouse from all sides. Using his ability to see through magical darkness, Teymir entered the front door of lighthouse, Azure began scaling one wall of the lighthouse using climbing pitons and grit, while Moonlight and Yang attempted to break into the window 40ft up on the western wall.

The Drow strategically were able to slow down the party using a mysterious substance they were able to conjure that swallowed all the light in its vicinity. After stepping inside and noticing an extreme heat and sulfur/ashen smell, Teymir climb the central staircase where he came face to face with the Drow figure who was more ornately dressed of the two Drow and began fighting to to toe with him.

Azure made it to the top of the lighthouse where he found a mysterious bottle of swirling smoke as well as 3 vials of clear blue liquid that seemed to look like a small ocean inside each one. He then came face to face with a dwarven figure with ashen gray skin and talk sharply spiked hair carrying a long stone-like sword.

As their fight ensued, Azure grabbed the glowing blue light source of the lighthouse and surprisingly found himself covered in an ice-like coating over his whole body. Yang and Moonlight successfully scaled the western wall after Yang creatively thought to throw his quarterstaff through the window with a rope tied to it. They leapt through the window to total darkness in the room and so far had not seen any figures except hearing the shouting of a human voice saying, "Please leave, they'll kill my family."

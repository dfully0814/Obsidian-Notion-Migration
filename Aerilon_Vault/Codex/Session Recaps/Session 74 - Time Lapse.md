# Last we left off...
You continued exploring [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]’s spaceship, The [[Paramount]], as you gained more information regarding Ainsley’s mission, some of the ongoing events in [[Aerilon]] around you, and the nature of the ship, its mission, and its remaining occupants.

You learned from [[Lyra]] that there is currently a war raging between an alien race of creatures she referred to as the [[Githyanki]] (Gith for short) and [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]’s people, the [[Giff]]. She did not give details regarding the nature or cause of the war, but she shared that [[Zera]], who she referred to as a [[Githzerai]], who is currently contained in the ship’s infirmary, had become a close friend of Captain Ainsley’s. Lyra told you that Zera’s people, the Githyanki, were after him for undisclosed reasons. It seems a rift had been created between the Githyanki and Githzerai that Zera had some hand in creating or influencing. In order to protect Zera from falling into the hands of the Githyanki, Ainsley found a way to travel into a [[Transitory Plane]] from somewhere in the material universe.

However, Ainsley did not fully understand the nature of this mysterious plane, which seemed to be a hub of sorts to other dimensional spaces and was filled with all manner of unknowable creatures that did not behave or communicate like anything Ainsley or his crew had encountered in their travels. While there, Ainsley and the crew discovered the [[Transitory Plane]] contained colonies of Githyanki, native to the material universe but were not able to determine why they were there as they kept distant from them to protect Zera.

Soon after the crew arrived, there was what Lyra could only describe as a storm of sorts as the silvery sky began to thrumb, darkness enveloped the crew for several minutes as Zera seemed to become paralyzed and exhibit other strange symptoms. Once the phenomena passed, the crew discovered Zera to be afflicted with some sort of strange malady, causing his yellowish-green skin to turn black as he began reporting hearing voices and gradually began to lose control of his psionic abilities sending uncontrolled bursts out from his body and putting the ship in severe danger. Seeing his crew in imminent danger, Ainsley traveled back to the material plane at a location distant from the Githyanki and began researching Zera’s malady.

Once back on the material plane, Zera seemed to be able to “hold back” the malady from taking over his body and mind further with his own psionic abilities somehow so the crew placed Zera in an isolation chamber in the ship’s Infirmary to allow him to come to a suspended state of consciousness in order to devote his full psionic abilities to staving off the malady. Lyra also told you that during his research, Ainsley discovered that Toril was also afflicted with a similar malady and he had come to Toril in order to learn more about it and how he could cure Zera.

[[Teymir]] also investigated more of the holographic maps from the ship’s main console, seeing sparsely populated heat signature’s in the uncharted north of [[Aerilon]] and a wide emptiness over where [[Thornhold]] is located as though something was blocking any cataloguing of that area. Lyra told you that it would take about an hour for [[ROMA]] to run full diagnostics on the ship to assess its damages. She also agreed to run a trace for [[Mary Emsworth]], the ship’s first mate as you found out all members of the crew carried emergency beacons with them so they could be located.

Teymir, [[Yang Tieh]], and [[Azure Flint]] also managed to successfully help Lyra repair the hole in the ship which was leaking [[Blueshift]] fuel. Azure then swam out of the ship, confronting another one of the sharks drawn to the ship’s hatch by the corpses of other sharks congregated there. As he spoke to the shark to intimidate it into leaving, he saw a large humanoid face seemingly slam from within the water near the shark, sending ripples outward, and dropping Azure’s book out of its mouth. On its pages, Azure read the words, “Go see Miss Astrid in the Mere of Dead Men.”

Yang then investigated the [[Biology Lab]] through its porthole in the door as Yang saw sconces and cabinets shifting in the room but seeing nothing there. As Yang turned to walk away he felt an intense force attack his mind but he was able to withstand it and kept moving.

Becoming increasingly uneasy since boarding the ship, Ell attempted to run off of the flight deck past Azure and a sleeping [[Gerard Vos]] as Azure managed to paralyze her and cause a dangling tentacle to wrap around her neck. He then consulted his book, asking it what to do with her, which it responded with only empty pages. He then let her go, realizing in the moment something about [[Elleanna Corvus]] reminded him of the love he left and realizing his difficulty being angry with her or himself.

Lastly, Teymir and Yang investigated the ship’s infirmary. They requested access to the room from ROMA. As they entered, a strong gravitational force pulled both individuals toward a metal table with a black and opaque cylindrical lid. Yang managed to quickly grab a cabinet and hold tight enough to withstand the force while Teymir was suddenly pulled rapidly toward the table and into the darkness within. Within seconds, he shot out the opposite side of the table into the wall. As Yang struggled over to him amidst the ongoing heavy force, he saw Teymir had a long and thick beard, looking slightly aged. Lyra then asked Teymir what happened and what he had seen. She became increasingly concerned as Teymir described residual details he could remember. She then began to say he would need to be tested quickly but the tools to do so were in the Biology Lab.

And that’s where we pick up...

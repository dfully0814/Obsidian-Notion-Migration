#recap 
# Last we left off...
The party woke up to the morning sun and the sound of the ocean waves. You began discussing your path forward to find [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] and discover more information about all you have seen thus far. [[Yang Tieh]] mentioned that he had a contact in the work camp and trade post known as [[Carnath Roadhouse]], but the party ultimately decided to travel east through the [[Dessarin Valley]] to [[Kheldell]], a settlement you discovered on the map.

[[Teymir]] mentioned he needed some time to himself to gather his thoughts and compose himself after the harrowing events your part has encountered over the past week and a half. Teymir made his way to the beach, reflecting on all that's happened, being tempted to give up on the pursuit of his past at one point. In the midst of his reflections, a bright radiant bird appeared to him in what initially seemed like only a vision until he opened his eyes and saw the bird on the beach next to him. Over the rest of the day, Teymir discovered he could communicate with this bird, choose at times to see what it sees and hear what it hears, but doesn't know its nature or source.

Meanwhile, [[Azure Flint]] spied on a group of 10 [[Everwatch Knights]] escorting what sounded like a male and female prisoner south down the high road. Using his clairvoyance ability, Azure heard one solider, who appeared to be in charge, mention authoritatively that they would "Re-supply with the garrison in [[Thornhold]] and continue to [[Red Larch]] after they would find the rest of their friends after dropping these two off in [[Waterdeep]]." The party then set out through the jungle toward the [[High Road]] in the direction of the settlement of Kheldell, making camp for your first night on the road.

During Teymir's watch, his new radiant companion saw what looked like a large group of figures traveling south down the[[ Long Road]]. He learned from reading more in the Temple Tome that he found that [[Telamont Tanthul]] theorized about the existence of what he called "Transitory Realities" that acted as doorways or gates between conjoining or adjacent realities, which those of arcane prowess could utilize and leverage. During Yang's watch, a rat entered the camp, speaking in the voice of a halfling man and pleading with him to come "Call off your beast."

As he followed the rat deep into the forest away from the camp, [[Yang Tieh]] saw a large tree in a clearing and Kaya poking his head into a large and thick patch of roots at the base of the tree. After calling him back, a small halfling man stepped out of a gap in the roots who seemed to be dressed in what was once bright and flamboyant clothes with ballooned pants and shaggy black hair and a bushy black beard. He seemed to have a nervous tick where he would cackle occasionally as he spoke.

He told Yang that he used to live with the "crowds" but not lives in the based of this tree that he named the "[[Gulthias Tree]]" after his father. He mentioned that the [[Everwatchers]] were after him and that's why he ran and hid. He also referred to the Everwatchers as the "The Eyes" and said that they have "eyes everywhere" and if the party had no confrontation with them while traveling across the Dessarin Valley, it was likely because they wanted them be where they are now. The halfling introduced himself as "[[Pippal]]". As Yang continued to approach Pippal closer, he fearfully continued stepping back until he stepped back into the open gap in the roots and disappeared. That's where we pick up. Yang remains in the center of the forest while the rest of the party sleeps soundly and unawares in the camp.

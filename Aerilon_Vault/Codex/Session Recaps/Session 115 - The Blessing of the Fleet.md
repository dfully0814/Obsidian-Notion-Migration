# Last we left off...

You began as [[Elleanna Corvus]] briefly explained to [[Teymir]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] that [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] had "turned" and a "creature" that she had seen, although she didn't have time to give much detail with the other two [[Everwatch Knights]] nearby. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] then lead the majority of the group back down to the camp in the valley while [[Teymir]], [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]], [[Guardian Edward Jaxon]] buried [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] and [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] spoken final rites over his body before covering the grave.

You then made plans for how you would enter [[Luskan]]. You decided that [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Gerard Vos]] would enter the city after [[Murlough Grahlund]] warned you that security in the city would likely be very high based on recent events in [[Phandalin]] and the fact that [[Luskan]] is the central seat of power for the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], many believing the city to be the very place where the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] was founded. [[Murlough Grahlund]] told you that at least here in the North, the [[Everwatch Knights]] carry devices they call [[Sight Stones]] which contain some kind of magical properties that can reveal if someone has the capabilities of using magic. He said these devices are more refined that similar ones used further south, which can only detect if someone has had a tracking stone placed in their body by the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] indicating that they are students of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]]. 

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Gerard Vos]] made their way to [[Luskan]] as they began to see fireworks rise up from the city along with the sound of bustling crowds, music, and celebration. The harbor of the city was filled with large galleon ships and towering merchant vessels, all decorated with lanterns and other lights with people dancing aboard their decks. Seeing the bustling harbor and recalling this late winter time of year, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] recalled from his studies that your party must have arrived to the city during the celebration of the [[Blessing of the Fleet]], a local celebration in [[Luskan]] that takes place during late winter when the ice in the north begins to somewhat thaw and the local clergy bless the ships and their crews, asking for protection and success in their voyages. This is often followed by a procession of ships through the harbor, with the crews waving to the crowds and tossing flowers and other offerings into the water.

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Gerard Vos]] successfully made their way into the city, being scanned with [[Sight Stones]] at the gate and seeing large automatons patrolling the city gates as well as inside, along with a large retinue of [[Everwatch Knights]] posted at each store front and business establishment. As they passed through the city they began to hear excited rumors that [[Iman Amel]] would be attending the [[Day of Wonders]] parade in 1 hour. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Gerard Vos]] both knew [[Iman Amel]] to be the Archmage of Cultivation in the [[Arcane Brotherhood]], the headmaster of the [[Host Tower of the Arcane]], the towering structure in the center of [[Luskan]] where students of the brotherhood are trained.

[[Gerard Vos]] then recommended that they travel over to [[The Royal Arms Inn]] to maybe find some information on how they might could get [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] into the city unnoticed due to their magical abilities. They entered the establishment, which was decorated to look like a slice of the wealthy south in this desolate area as the two encountered familiar sights and smells from the [[Dessarin Valley]]. The patrons were dressed to the nines and dancing in formal two-steps common to the South.

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] noticed a female tie-fling working behind the bar and asked if there were any time the gates to the city wouldn't be guarded as heavily, trying not to give too much of his intention away. Pointing long and lanky fingers at him and appearing fairly eccentric, she told him that in 1 hour during the parade would be the best time when the [[Day of Wonders]] parade begins, followed by the [[Blessing of the Fleet]] event when much of the guard would be focused on the harbor.

[[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Gerard Vos]] then took that information and traveled over to the docks to look for [[Gilas]], who had been sent some days before by [[Sighi Thorgison]] to provide ferry transportation back to [[Neverwinter]] if needed. The two found [[Gilas]] and then took the ferry up the [[River Mirar]] to the bank outside the city where [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Asad Al-Nuri]], and the rest of the group waited as [[Elleanna Corvus]] looked on into the city seeing familiar silvery symbols of [[Auril]] ignite in the night sky high above the city, reminding her of a familiar parade and performing troupe in [[Phandalin]] that preceded untold desolation. 

And that's where we pick up....

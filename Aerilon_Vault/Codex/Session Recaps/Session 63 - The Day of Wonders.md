#recap 
# Last we left off...
You entered into the bustling city of [[Phandalin]], seeing that the city had seen a lot of prosperity over the past several years due the discovery of fine metals in the [[Sword Mountains]] currently being mined mostly by [[Phylund Works]], an industrial conglomerate operating throughout North [[Aerilon]], which [[Gerard Vos]] remembered he had worked with in the past.

You saw a large barge-like air ship hovering over the system with a bright blue sign that read "The [[Sea Maiden's Faire]]." You followed crowds of people through the city gates, surprised at the lack of security enforced by the [[Everwatch Knights]]. The crowd formed around the city center, [[Yang Tieh]] broke off from the group and the rest of the group made their way to the [[Stonehill Inn]], a two-story diner bearing the same name as an older inn [[Elleanna Corvus]] remembered from her childhood growing up in Phandalin. The rest of the group made their way onto the second story balcony of the Stonehill Inn, seeing a 100 person orchestra assembled in the middle of the city center and surrounded at 4 points around the orchestra by members of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] with flowing blue robes threaded with gold and staves with bright yellow and orange spheres swirling in the middle of the head of the staff.

You watched as a charismatic human figure walked onto a platform set up in the middle of the orchestra with short and black hair, well-groomed, a turquoise vest with gold thread, and tight fitting back garments underneath with pointed black boots. He gave a speech to the packed crowd surrounding the city center and announced the beginning of the [[Day of Wonders]] Parade telling the crowd that the event was for all those who fight for Aerilon and those who have not been recognized and felt unappreciated, saying that this time was their chance to be whoever they want.

The parade begin as various major magical feats were put on display, top hat figures with glow-in-the-dark makeup sending flying illusions into the air, gold and red clothed figures with Venecian masks with attached wings sending glowing traces in the air as they danced, finely-dressed giant figures with glowing orbs they would throw into the air that would explode and rain roses down into the crowd, etc. You also saw a 10ft tall white wolf with ice sickle-like fur surrounded by female dancers arrayed in white with snow-flake shaped headdresses and a more prominent figure mounted on the wolf who seemed to begin to send forms in the shape of the [[Frostveils]] into the city center, forming the diamond-shape of [[Auril]] that eventually rose into the air in sync with fireworks shooting from the floating barge above and then exploding into a shower of snow back down onto the crowd at the finale of the parade.

Once the parade concluded, the group made their way to the [[Sleeping Giant Inn]], which you were told would be a good place to find lodging. You found the Sleeping Giant to be an upscale strip club and gambling area on the bottom floor with lodging on subsequent floors. The group chose to pay for the VIP room on the top 3rd floor of the establishment. You entered the room finding fine marble floors with fine red rugs, a canopied bed, jacuzzi-style bathtub, and open window design looking down into the city.

Ell grabbed a bottle of alcohol from the mini bar in the room and walked outside, eventually drinking the entire bottle and becoming intoxicated. In her loss of inhibitions, she communicated her desire to possibly break away from [[Galladon]]'s influence and she asked if [[Teymir]] would have her back. She also showed him the communicator that she carries and told him about how she communicates with Galladon through it.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] followed a few of the festival workers out of the city and tried to interact with some of them, particularly interested in the female figure riding the white wolf. He found her to not believe in the actual existence of [[Auril]] but only using her mythology to draw crowds during the Winter season. Yang also managed to find out the proprietor of the [[Sea Maiden's Faire]] was a man named [[Zardoz Zord]], the figure you saw conducting the orchestra wearing the turquoise vest during the parade.

Teymir managed to find Zardoz Zord in the Sleeping Giant and asked him about how he was able to get approval to use so much magic in his performances in such an overt way. He responded by telling Teymir it simply seems the [[Everwatchers]] are interested in maintaining some level of peace and joy during the turbulent times of riots in various areas and imminent war with [[Thay]] that you know to be occurring. He also mentioned there was nothing or no one that cannot be bought. He probed more about things he might be hiding; he told Teymir he might be willing to give more information if your group acquires an item for him from an Everwatcher weapon cache in [[Mt Hotenow]] northwest of your location.

Vos began to walk around looking at the various festival tents set up around the city. He found one tent named [[Ms. Florina's Fantasmagoria]] with a long line leading out of the tent and wrapping around behind it. As he entered the tent, he saw a table covered by a red-checkered tablecloth and a string-haired older female figure with red skin and yellow eyes. As he sat down, she took out a back as Vos began drawing out of it various random items as the woman began telling him his fortune based on what he drew. When it came time for the third draw, the female figure looked at Vos and told him that she would reward him with a powerful item if he would draw from a nearby deck of black cards instead of drawing from the bag. He chose to draw from the deck of cards and was awarded a powerful spell bottle. As he flipped the card over it was initially blank and then gradually the black and white outline of flames began to appear on the card. The woman thanked Vos for coming in and told him not to worry about losing the card; he wouldn't be able. As he exited the tent he looked across the city center and on the opposite side he saw a twisted and distorted humanoid form standing and looking at it while the space around it seemed to be shimmering and no one else seemed to see the figure. The figure had arms coming from its shoulders and another set coming from under its harm. It was large and hulking and seemed to carry and oversized flaming axe in one of its hands. As it looked over to Vos, he heard a voice in his said say, "Good evening Mr. Vos. I believe we'll have plenty of time to get better acquainted" as it began to cackle.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

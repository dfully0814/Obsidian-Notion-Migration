#recap 
# Last we left off...

The carnage from a sudden ambush continued across a snowy battlefield as [[Teymir]], [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Murlough Grahlund]], a cyborg figure, and an [[Everwatch Knights]] commander held converged and attacked the frost giant that took the life from [[Gerard Vos]]. The group managed to eventually bring the giant down as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] made his way over to the lifeless body of [[Gerard Vos]] while [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] ran toward the train to inspect a large gash in the train's side which he noticed to be the Steerage compartment. 

Finding [[Gerard Vos]]'s still body lying atop pooling blood, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] knelt to the ground and began a ritual over him, calling out to [[Horus]] for aid. As he spoke the incantation over the body, [[Gerard Vos]] opened his eyes to find himself sitting in a familiar place, although he didn't know why it was familiar exactly. He found himself sitting on a series of rocks looking out over a calm ocean beneath a starry night sky.

Across from him sat a much younger [[Brandt]], maybe 15 years younger. He watched as [[Brandt]] looked over to him and said,

> Remember when we used to come here when we were kids? When you would come stay with us while your dad was off on deployment? Damn, I used to hate the water. Whenever we'd dream about discovering the world together, you'd always tell me that if I didn't deal with it then other folks would get to all the good places first and it wasn't no fun finding something second. You were always the brave one between us. When the Watchers pulled my number for the program, I know you went in my place 'cause you knew I want'd ready. I still remember the day I read your letter telling me what you'd done. 
> 
>  This business venture. I don't know. The Watchers 'been using every resource they' got to hunt down every Scourger from here to the east. What makes you think we can amass enough money, resources, and connections to disappear?
> Vos responds, "'Cause I'm smarter than they are."
> 
> Brandt again, "Hehe. Well you better the hell be." Look, I met a man named [[Korris]] in [[Yartar]]. Low-level security guy for some fat cat named [[Harlex Phylund]] not satisfied with his current employer. He's got some connections that should help us with new identities, but it ain't gonna be cheap and I don't know how far we're gonna have to go. 
> Look, I didn't come out here to talk business. Hell, you know I ain't good at these kinda things. I know every time you kill, it takes a little piece of ya' that you don't get back and most of you didn't come back.  You know, for my money they got the better pick of the two of us, but dammit Bren it was supposed to be me. What am I supposed to do?
> 
> Vos: When this is done, get a pretty wife. Some kids. Big yard. The whole thing.

[[Gerard Vos]] looked in the distance and saw small green motes of light begin to slowly rise up from behind the ocean's horizon high into the air, flittering like lanterns holding firelight inside.

He then turned to see a gaunt and lanky form of a woman wearing a plain gray robe with hood half covering a sallow impossibly pale face as though her face was made of porcelain. He then heard the woman speak,

> Guide: Memory and time transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.
> Memory can be such consolation when you find yourself dashed upon the rocks by the winds of the world. It took some doing to find something strong enough to tether you here. It may appear to you as though there is nothing left of the crucible of your soul to be passed through the fire again, and yet here you are. 
> Many centuries ago, a small group of creatures from beyond the world taught me how to carve a reality from the strong memories of those who carry them. I was asked to not allow your soul to spill into the void. 

She went on to explain that what he experienced was in fact a real memory that had been forcibly taken from him for reasons she appeared not to know. She explained that she had used this memory to carve out a temporary safe space for [[Gerard Vos]] to protect him from "oblivion". She said that the mere existence of a memory like this depicting what he had done for [[Brandt]] showed that maybe he wasn't as entirely lost as he believed himself to be. She also explained that another party had requested she hold him here and give the next instructions.

She then told [[Gerard Vos]] that in order to move forward to the next step, he would need to get into a small boat and start rowing, which he did.

He began to row in the dark ocean toward the horizon until he suddenly found himself sitting in a sand-worn train car that exactly depicted the one from which he had just come except for its age and weather-beaten state.

He began to make his way through the cars until he came to the dining car where a bartender stood behind the counter, dressed in fine attire, exactly resembling the bartender he had just conversed with the night before, who had struck him as somewhat odd even then. 

As he sat down and began conversing with the bartender, who seemed to remember his preferred drink, he felt a heavy hand on his shoulder. He turned to see [[Asad Al-Nuri]] who introduced himself as a "servant" and "guide" for what's next. The figure explained that his god had chosen to give [[Gerard Vos]] a chance at redemption for his many evils and sins. He told [[Gerard Vos]] that there was a great evil that had bound itself to him, almost a seeming manifestation of the evil [[Gerard Vos]] himself knew he has done. The figure told [[Gerard Vos]] that in the next car his heart would be weighed in the scales and he would confess his sins and his god would decide what was next. After some deliberation and hesitancy whether or not he wanted this second chance, not knowing the costs, [[Gerard Vos]] eventually made his way forward into the next car.

Here, he saw a series of decorative clay pots depicted different heads of animals engraved on them. The figure that had taken [[Asad Al-Nuri]]'s form explained this was the gateway to beyond....to the [[Duat]]. [[Gerard Vos]] stepped forward into the next car where he entered a completely dark room and the door closed behind him.

He then watched as a series of glowing and interconnected dodecahedron shapes began to form all around the dark invisible wall and floor forming a fiery web-like pattern all around him that made the space appear dome-shaped and finite. He then heard an ancient, low, and calm voice say, "Confess your sins." [[Gerard Vos]] immediately felt in his soul a deep, piercing, and disembodied stare from unknown origin-- a stare that seemed to be able to see to the deepest of his being. He responded by saying, "I've killed a lot of people." The voice knew that he was once a soldier and asked if those he killed deserved it, to which [[Gerard Vos]] remarked that some did and some didn't.

The voice then seemingly formed into the similar bartender again and began walking toward [[Gerard Vos]].

He continued and explained that the demon who had attached himself to [[Gerard Vos]] was formed by a powerful, dark, and terrible power. He said the demon's name is [[Duamutef]] and that the stringy-haired female he met in [[Ms. Florina's Fantasmagoria]] was in fact a priestess of [[Set]] in disguise, [[High Priestess Nefertari]] who had been sent to [[Aerilon]] to test a powerful artifact she had created for [[Septizim Gamal]] that seemingly carried the power to bind a creature like this. What she did not anticipate was that as [[Duamutef]] was unleashed upon city after city across [[Aerilon]], his power would grow from the chaos and violence he inflicts and caused people to inflict on one another. Unexpectedly he lately reached a level of power in which he managed to break the bonds the priestess had over him and destroy her. Now, his chaos and violence run rampant across the world--untethered. He told [[Gerard Vos]] that his task would be to stop [[Duamutef]] as well as the evil from which he came before it consumes the world. He also told [[Gerard Vos]] that in order to face [[Duamutef]] he would have to draw him out using what entices [[Duamutef]] the most--chaos, violence, and public spectacle. 

The bartender then gave [[Gerard Vos]] a fine wide-brimmed hat with an red-orange feather in it and told him this would help him in his task. He also told [[Gerard Vos]] that there is always a cost to intervening in the path of an individual to the [[Duat]]. He told [[Gerard Vos]] that once his task was complete, he would come back to reclaim him. He encouraged [[Gerard Vos]], however, that not many men have the privilege to know the number of their days and that he encourages him to make the most of them and reclaim the soldier he once was and the honor thereof.

The room then began to disappear and [[Gerard Vos]] shot awake on the snowy ground coughing and choking on the blood in his lungs as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] looked over him and watched as [[Gerard Vos]] mortal wounds became to magically stitch themselves up with a thread seemingly held together by small, glowing hieroglyphs.

Meanwhile, seeing a group of more Shadowghasts coming, [[Teymir]], [[Murlough Grahlund]], and the cyborg figure raced to head them off while other fighting continued to the east where the commander rushed to aid his fellow soldiers. To the southeast of the battlefield, a group of giants now roam around looming over a large contingent of knights and their commander who have been eviscerated on the ground.

And that's where we pick up...

# Last we left off...
[[Yang Tieh]] looked down to see a confused [[Elleanna Corvus]] lying on the snow-covered bridge beside him. As she began to get her bearings, [[Yang Tieh]] frustratingly looked down to her and said, "With all the visions you and [[Teymir]] have, you couldn't just let me enjoy my own vision alone?"

As the two began conversing over what had transpired and searched around them for any immediate threats, they heard an ambient and booming voice once again sounding as though it was belabored and traveling across a great distance. The voice said, "[[Yang Tieh]], you have power and strength. But the journey only begins with these. You must be willing to sacrifice for those you are beside or YOU WILL FAIL."

At this point, a massive lightning bolt exploded from the sky, splitting the large stone bridge in half and sending [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Yang Tieh]] plummeting 60ft to the snow-covered ground below. Once they landed safely through either magical means or martial poise, they watched as the outline of three reptilian-like creatures with humanoid upper bodies and snake-like lower halves began to form around them from the snow and then fill on the inside with water and freeze, creating solid bodies of jagged ice. The creatures then attacked and seemed to specifically target [[Elleanna Corvus]] as they lashed out with sharp claws of ice and freezing breath, also possessing the ability to disappear and reappear as though they were carried by the snow and wind. The conflict eventually transitioned on top of the now broken bridge 60ft in the air when [[Elleanna Corvus]] conjured a series of duplicate images of her to confuse and stave of the creatures' onslaught and [[Yang Tieh]] continued slashing and stabbing with his spear and attempting to stun and frighten some of the creatures to keep them from [[Elleanna Corvus]].

[[Elleanna Corvus]] soon succumbed to the continued slashing of the creatures, fell unconscious, and began plummeting back to the ground. In response, [[Yang Tieh]] activated his boots borrowed form [[Cassius Cromwell]] and dove off the side of the bridge after [[Elleanna Corvus]], soon managing to catch her in mid-air and break her fall. He then stabilized her as two remaining creatures looked on from the bridge.

Meanwhile, a winged creature of shadow that had risen from the fallen body of the blue-skinned humanoid with [[Draconic]] features and a black dragon mask, rushed in to attack [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] in the underground wine cellar of the [[Cassalanter Mountain Villa]] as the rest of the party heard the commotion and began running down the steps and made their way to the room. However, before they arrived the winged creature flew up near the ceiling with its ethereal spear in hand, stabbed into the wall and began ripping open the wall from end to end as some of the [[Draconic]] runes began to go dark and an opaque dark essence began to billow into the room. 

Overtaken by whatever influence seemed to come along with the darkness, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] suddenly found himself believing [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] had many of the answers he has been seeking for who knows how long and has refused to give up the information he has. The party watched as [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] suddenly lunged at [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] with his katana, attempting to get behind him and cut at his throat. In one single motion, [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] dodged his attack and managed to grab the hilt of the katana and wrest it from [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s grasp. [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] then looked over to [[Gerard Vos]] and said, "Mr. Vos, I don't think I trust your friend here."

And that's where we pick up....

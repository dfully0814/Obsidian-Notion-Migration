#recap 
# Last we left off...
As [[Elleanna Corvus]] slipped from consciousness, she awoke standing on a familiar pier outside the city of [[Neverwinter]]. At the end of the pier sat [[Galladon]] motioning for her to walk over. She sensed a surge of emotion she hadn't experienced since coming to [[Nulmoria]], falling on her knees and realizing this was a memory of her's. Galladon walked over, helped her up and embraced her for several moments before leading her back over to the edge of the pier. Galladon comforted her and told her that [[Tharizdun]] had attempted to take her, and he had considered allowing it to happen. He began to share with Ell how [[Nulmoria]] was the leftover remnants of the previous world the Sirin had attempted to unmake during the The Consummation in order to eradicate creation's memory of Tharizdun.

He told Ell that Tharizdun exists beyond space and time and that wherever memory of him resides, he resides. He shared that memory itself has power and potentiality. He told her that Tharizdun has begun creating various "soldiers' ' they have given different designations depending on their abilities. [[Dreadmasters]] are typically high in charisma, while [[Shadovar]] are high in intelligence and usually more willingly give themselves over.

He told Ell that [[Tanavast Adamantus]] is now a Dreadmaster and that Dreadmasters must carry several trinkets with them to maintain enough remnant memory of their former selves to make them powerful, but not so much that they are outside Tharizdun's influence. He told Ell that whenever someone dies in The Sundered Plane, Tharizdun has much stronger influence over them because the plane is where all of his essence remained after Sirin's failed [[Consummation]] that sundered the world in two. [[Galladon]] said that now Tharizdun's influence only grows, which presses [[Nulmoria]] into adjoining planes as it grows.

Tensions continued to mount in The [[Everwatch Knights]] encampment, [[Gerard Vos]] pretending to hold a live grenade in his hand while a soldier hurried to bring back [[Captain Roland Royston]]. As the soldier searched for the captain, [[Teymir]] ran back to the tent of [[Lady Liane Antient]] to inform her of the conflict that had occurred outside [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]'s tent. As she ran toward the scene with Teymir, she informed him that giving blood was standard procedure and she would not allow him to do so if she had thought it would compromise his identity to The [[Everwatchers]] in some way.

When they arrived at the scene, Captain Royston had already arrived, proceeded to have the soldiers disarm Azure by removing his laser rifle, and then began a confrontation with [[Yang Tieh]]. Yang began to explain to the captain what had occurred, but the conversation quickly became more confrontational as Yang Tieh attempted to instruct Captain Royston how to manage his men. In anger, Captain Royston grabbed Yang by the neck, lifted him up, and told him that if he attempted to tell him how to command his own men again he would spill all of his blood and he wouldn't need worry about giving a single vial. He then threw Yang down to the ground and began shouting for Lord Symund to be brought to him when Yang told him what Lord Symund had done to Ell.

Lord Symund walked to the scene as the captain called him and began to ambivalently respond to the captain's inquiries regarding what had occurred. The captain then grabbed Lord Symund by the throat and slammed him onto the ground, proceeding to pin him there while shouting for [[Bertio Cassalanter]], [[Archmage of Diplomatic Union]] in [[The Arcane Brotherhood]]. He told Lord Bertio that he didn't care what kind of influence Lord Bertio had, if his son attacked another one of his men he would come after Lord Bertio, stating that he knows he can't kill Lord Symund.

He also told Lord Bertio that he's only tolerating his cursed family being in the camp because the knights need Lord Symund. Captain Royston then looked down at Lord Symund and demanded that he make it right. Royston then released Symund's neck, looked around at the group of soldiers who had congregated, and began to shout aloud that your only hope is each other. He told the men not to fight for every inch and that it's the accumulation of inches that will win the victory, whoever wants each inch the most.

Lord Symund then entered his tent and approached Ell and apologized for the unpleasantness that had occurred. He offered her two potions he said would aid her if she finds herself on the brink of death again. Ell took the vials and entered Lady Antient's tent looking for more answers regarding The [[The Guide]], the nature of memories in relation to [[Nulmoria]] and her father. Lady Antient shared with Ell that she had read of ancient students of [[Dunamis]] dabbling in the power of memory but more in a sacrosanct way and not as a means to implant or extract memory. Lady Antient, seeing Ell's anger and frustration over not having the answers she needs, took Ell's hands and began to comfort her and tell her that she saw a strength in her. She told Ell that she knew her father and she can see his strength in Ell.

Teymir then spoke with [[Master Aegith Rane]], the man he had learned was the one who trained him. Master Aegith was overjoyed to see Teymir. He began to speak much of Teymir's potential and power. He told Teymir that it was he who had wiped Teymir's memory in order to protect him. He told Teymir the [[Scourgers]] had been the arm [[High Protector Anamanue Silverhand]] had used to overthrow the previous emperor long ago and had later disbanded their use. All the Scourgers were then hunted down and killed except three, those whom Master Aegith had taken particular interest in saving--Teymir, Bren (Vos), and a third individual who Teymir only knows to be a female at this point. Master Aegith refused to tell Teymir anymore about his past and told him he was protecting him and that Teymir was on his own path now. He told Teymir that if he wanted to know more, he would have to discover it on his own. He also told Teymir that he believed his students must walk through fire on their own and come out the other side refined and stronger and he's proud to see Teymir has done so.

As your group began to search for Captain Royston again to begin your infiltration of the citadel, a large wave of flying creatures, shadowghasts, and white-haired beasts began pouring from the citadel to attack the camp. Captain Royston ran past you as he shouted for the soldiers to take up arms and told you that this was your best time now that the caverns below the citadel were less occupied with enemies. You all then rushed to the battlefield as chaos ensued, making your way up a nearby mountain by various means, killing a [[Drow]] sniper perched atop the mountain while another sniper across the ravine spotted you and began firing.

And that's where we pick up. Ell has spotted an entrance to the mountain from which she has seen some Shadowghasts exiting, a sniper across the ravine has you in his sights, and presumably Lord Symund makes his own way across the battlefield to join up with you as you prepare for your infiltration into the underbelly of The [[House Xorlarrin Citadel]].

# Last we left off...
You began planning for the arrival of a [[Thayan]] [[Retriever]] which has been hunting [[Cassius Cromwell]], a former Thayan soldier who has seemingly defected from the Thayan army due to atrocities inflicted by [[Thay]]'s government. After you made your preparations, the Retriever soon burst into your camp in a blaze of electrical energy and blinding light. This began an intense fight with the robotic creature, which immediately targeted Cassius and conjured a 20ft wall of lightning to segment the room in two, effectively separating [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Raene Cromwell]], and [[Caleb Cromwell]] off from the rest of the party. The creature immediately attacked Cassius, stunning him, lifting him up into his jaws, and attempted to burrow back into the ground with him.

With quick reflex, [[Yang Tieh]] was able to attack the creature as it began to burrow into the ground, preventing it from moving any further and allowing the rest of the party to surround it and begin attacking. In response to being surrounded, you watched as the creature transformed into a 15ft mechanical warrior with an oversized electrical blade forming into its arm. It seemed to display more magical ability by conjuring a maelstrom in the center of the cavern area, splitting the party in two.

After teleporting to its back, Cassius told Yang he managed to see a weak spot on the back of its neck where they might be able to interact with the elemental that powered the machine. Yang managed to climb onto the creature's back and stabbed his spear into the machine's weak spot, which began a battle of wills between him and the elemental. Cassius followed suit, also stabbing his sword into the same spot and began to help Yang attempt to overcome the elemental.

Realizing what they were attempting to do, the creature began to flail its body back and forth in an effort to throw them to the ground. Both held vigorously to its back as their bodies hung, suspended only by their grips on their weapons.

The rest of the party continued holding the creature's attention, [[Gerard Vos]] firing energy shots from afar, [[Teymir]] transforming into a dinosaur and facing off with the creature in close range, Ell temporarily banishing the creature to allow for further planning, and [[Azure Flint]] fending off oncoming groups of [[Darkweave]] infected occupants of the cave who were attracted to your location by the commotion.

Feeling the ebb and flow of primal energy playing a tug of war with his own will, Yang went through several waves of pushing and pulling against the creature's desire to come forward or remain bound to the machine. Yang eventually managed to overcome the creature's will as everyone in the cave watched as massive lightning bolts shot out of the creature's body in various directions, causing large boulders to fall from the ceiling, disintegrating many of the Darkweave, and soon resulting in the machine falling to its knees and then flat on its face as plumes of smoke rose from where it fell.

As you investigate the body of the machine, Vos discovered a flat rectangular [[Mythallar]] ingot connected to a series of wiring and tubes underneath the machine's chest with a large hole blown out of it. He also found a thick glass cylinder in the machine's head with what appeared to be blood swirling in it, not touching any side of the cylinder.

As you investigated the body of the machine, you began to hear the sound of something on the other side of the collapsed wall of the cave begun to very precisely cut into the rock. A smooth circular piece of stone dropped out of the collapsed rubble revealing a small and smooth tunnel in the rock out of which emerged a metallic sphere with a small raised segment of its body. From this raised segment emanated a bright red light. The small machine introduced itself as "[[Lyra]]", the creation and docent of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]. She shared that she and some of Ainsley's crew were finding shelter in the caves after Ainsley's ship went down in the ocean when it was caught in the otherworldly storm that has swept along the [[Sword Coast]]. She asked you for help to continue serving him to fulfill her directive and told you that she was not present at the time Ainsley died. However, she did mention that Ainsley installed a storage device in her neural network which stores the last 24 hours of Ainsley memory. She said it cannot be viewed directly but would need to be plugged into a console, the closest of which she said would be on the crashed ship. Finally, Lyra also shared with you that there is a working underwater vessel affixed to the bottom of Ainsley's ship that you should be able to use to circumvent the most severe surface dangers of the storm in your route to [[Thornhold]].

And that's where we pick up...

# Last we left off...
After you were initially spotted by a guard patrol of [[Drow]] in the cavern under the [[House Xhorlarrin]] citadel, a fight ensued between your group and a single guard patrol. One Drow figure that appeared to be a mage, managed to split your group after conjuring a darkness sphere that wrapped a cloud of poisonous gas. One of the armored Drow guards also managed to throw a grenade out into the open, expelling a loud whistling sound to attempt to alert any patrols near this cavern.

As your group split, [[Teymir]] attempted to use his claws acquired from [[Lady Liane Antiet]] to begin to burrow through the walls in an effort to find an escape route.

Yang and [[Azure Flint]] began to work together to take down a few of the patrol to the south, including a winged shadow creature summoned by the Drow mage.

As [[Elleanna Corvus]] teleported around the cavern, she saw an intriguing hooded figure in one of the cells with long clawed hands, pale yellowish-green skin, and jagged features to its face similar to the figure Teymir and Yang came across on the [[Paramount]] in the medical bay.

Azure managed to eventually defeat the Drow mage by impersonating one of the Drow guards, calling out to the mage by name in Undercommon and leading him into a glyph of warding which conjured large tentacles that slammed the mage helplessly into the jagged cavern wall next to him.

Teymir and [[Gerard Vos]] then saw a Drow warrior coming down a cavern tunnel near them mounted on a much larger arachnid humanoid faced creature and began to engage it, soon supported by Yang as well.

On the other side of the cavern, Ell saw the Drow mage fall and then soon after saw a wispy form emanate from one of the cavern walls and soon form into the physical figure of [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]. He lifted up his index figure over his mask where his mouth would be, turned around the corner to an area of the cavern where Ell saw a nest of eggs, as Ell began to hear the sound of popping and explosions and she saw bright flashes of light wrap around the corner of the cavern wall.

And that's where we pick up...

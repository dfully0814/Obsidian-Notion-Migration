# Last we left off...
You began in the secret stone corridor where a shadow form had plunged its ethereal sword into [[Gerard Vos]]'s chest. After suffering a few slashes from the creature's ethereal sword, [[Gerard Vos]] noticed his strength begin to drain with each cut of the sword and his body become increasingly frail to the point he was barely able to hold up his guns. Over the next few moments the part attacked the creature, managing to kill it after several slices from [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s newly acquired radiant katana, filling the creature's body with increasing numbers of radiant embers that appeared to pull its body apart.

You then made your way back down to the first floor of the villa, where you found the dead body of the [[Drow]] woman who had accompanied you up from the prison lying dead on the dining table and [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] pacing calmly around the room as wind and ash continued blowing in through the destroyed windows of the dining room. He explained that the woman saw him, held out a flashing red stone, and then violently attacked him. When investigating her body, [[Elleanna Corvus]] later noticed no new blood stains on the woman's axe, indicating she didn't seem to get even a single hit off before being killed by [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]].

[[Elleanna Corvus]] then asked [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] if there was anything he could do to help [[Gerard Vos]] in his current exhausted and gaunt condition. [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] then walked out of the room. While he was gone [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] discussed the events in the sub leading up to where you are now and [[Elleanna Corvus]] thanked [[Gerard Vos]] for standing in for her to de-escalate a situation that was becoming increasingly tense and potentially violent. [[Elleanna Corvus]] also searched the body of the Drow female and found the small blood stone she had been carrying and kept it.

[[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] soon came back with a hand-full of health potions and another mysterious vial continuing a blue liquid. He handed the health potions to [[Gerard Vos]] and then told him that the blue potion wouldn't be free. He then asked that [[Gerard Vos]] agree to do him a favor at any time of his Symund's choosing. After a time thoughtful deliberation, Vos agreed and the two shook hands as a radiant cord appeared out of Symund's gauntlet and wrapped itself around the two's wrist and then disappeared. Symund then cautioned Vos that it would be in his best interest to keep his promise.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began searching the main house of the villa for supplies and any items that could be of use for the journey ahead. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] managed to find a secret library behind a wall with a wine rack on it where he and [[Yang Tieh]] discovered a shelf full of jars containing various colored swirling mists, which [[Yang Tieh]] recognized that your group had come across in the past. Each jar seemed to contain 20 seconds of recorded sound. Finding a jar in the back corner of one of the shelves, [[Yang Tieh]] listened to one of the few jars containing a red mist. The recording was an excerpt from audio research notes given by [[Vincent Cassalanter]], the family archivist. The recording stated that "[[Ammalia Cassalanter]] is not what we believed. I've discovered she was a pupil of the notorious [[Sammaster Arran]]. There's little time. We're in danger." [[Yang Tieh]] rememebered from hearing many conversations your party has had concerning [[Kwalish's Journal]] that [[Sammaster Arran]] was a Netherese archmage believed to be the founder of the dragon cult the [[Wyrmspeakers]].

[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] also came across an interesting-looking book called "Agharion's Dragonward, the Lectures of Khelben Arunsun regarding the technological marvel surrounding the city of [[Waterdeep]]," which [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] has not yet managed to look through more thoroughly.

[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] then eventually made there way upstairs in the main house where they found a grand ballroom with a single automated construct dancing and asking for their bidding. [[Yang Tieh]] eventually managed to get the construct to agree to lead them to the wine cellar in the villa. Before beginning to traverse down to the cellar, they looked through the remaining upper floors of the house where they eventually came to another much smaller study that appeared to have been broken into. Here, they found a large red grimoire that appeared to be the diary of [[Elyn Cassalanter]], wife of [[Bertio Cassalanter]] and mother of [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]], conspicuously left out in the open and unprotected. [[Yang Tieh]] began to skim through the grimoire and found significant mention of [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]].  The writings made mention of many different sorts of magically experimentations it seems the two had been performing on Symund since he was a boy. Yang also found hopeful mentions of a "breakthrough" at various points. Through quickly skimming through this large tome, he wasn't able to find a motive for this.

The two also found a ladder leading up into an open trap door that lead to an attic where they found a single pair of shackles bound to the wall, a single bed, and slat in the wall that looked like it had been slid open and not put back securely. Behind this slat, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] found an open black chest containing a small and sharp black shard of some kind of hardened material with a light sheen to it. The shard seemed to emanate light whispers and appeared to attempt to draw [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] into discovered more about it. [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] sat in the attic investigating this shard for a few moments while the party remains separated in the villa.

And that's where we pick up...

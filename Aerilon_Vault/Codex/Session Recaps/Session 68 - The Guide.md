#recap 
# Last we left off...
[[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Teymir]] continued their harrowing plummet from the ridges of the [[Sword Mountains]] when [[Azure Flint]] suddenly leapt from [[Yang Tieh]]'s galloping horse, throwing himself off the ledge as well, choosing to let Ell fall past him and then casting feather fall on Teymir to slow his rapid descent. Acknowledging Azure's help but also wanting to catch up with Ell to aid her, Teymir landed on a surface of the mountain edge, breaking the feather fall and continuing to plummet. The three characters soon made it safely to the ground, Teymir taking some damage as he cascaded through a series of thick frozen foliage before landing on the ground.

As Yang and [[Gerard Vos]] galloped back down the slopes on [[Noctis]] and [[Tahari]], they both did not detect any sign that the [[Chimera]] was following any of you.

Expertly telegraphing his descent, Azure managed to land in the top area of a tall tree. He was able to look off in the distance to see an unnaturally tall tower erected in the middle of [[Leilon]]. He remembers the city being famous as a tourist attraction focused on this tower. He recalled the city was built around the tower, but no one trues the true purpose of the tower and its historical significance—there is mostly only myth and conjecture.

You then continued forward to Leilon, stopping an hour or so from the city in the valley to camp for the evening.

During the first watch, Yang and Teymir began discussing Teymir and Ell leaving Yang and Vos to fight for themselves in [[Phandalin]], and Yang expressing his displeasure with being left as they were. He again expressed his distrust for Ell and Teymir mentioned that it was probably good for him not to trust her so that balances out any lack of objectivity Teymir might have when it comes to her. Teymir also confronted Yang about leaving the group on several occasions in the past.

Yang then asked Teymir if it scared him when the creature attempted to fragment and frenzy his mind in Phandalin. Teymir responded that it did and Yang responded by asking Teymir if he would like to learn how to fight it. Teymir said he was eager to do so.

As you continued through the evening with no sign of [[Galladon]] coming to meet Ell, Teymir woke Ell up to tell her he hadn't seen Galladon. At that moment, you all saw a bright flash of green light high up in the Sword Mountains as you simultaneously watched Ell's body begin to dissolve into nothing until she was gone.

Ell then found herself standing ankle-deep in clear ocean water, the shore around her gray and dull, the trees gnarled and looming toward her, quarter-sized ash falling from a muted dark gray sky, and sharp gravel where there should be sand.

Behind her, she saw a sprawling mountain range. Nearest the shore through a U-shaped opening in the mountains, she saw a huge black citadel built into the side of the mountain overlooking the sea with a series of tall black and narrow spires, some of which reached beyond the gray clouds above.

Ell noticed an ancient and disheveled stone path leading off the shore and toward the U-shaped opening in the mountains, which was overgrown with large black roots coming up from the ground and flanked on both sides by large patches of gaunt and looming trees.

In the distance, Ell saw a large golden tree shining like the sun that seemed to shine down onto a city at the base of the citadel's mountain, seeming to grow slightly more dim as Ell continued to look. The city exhumed a pale green glow.

Ell noticed a surprising lack of emotion and feeling as she stood in the water; her emotions seemed to be replaced by a sense of objectivity, lack of obligation, and emptiness and mourning.

Galladon then walked up behind Ell as she stood on the shoreline, taking the form of her father [[Tanavast Adamantus]], and telling Ell that he thought this would be a more pleasing form as he knows what is coming will be difficult. He told her he was surprised to see her here; that a normal person enduring what her father is currently enduring would have "let go" by now, adding that Ell must be one hell of a daughter.

He then took Ell's hand, leading her back into the ocean, deeper into the water as Ell began to hear a host of different voices, screams, laughing, crying, etc. She then saw a door way open in the water like a curtain as she stepped into a large obsidian room with 7ft wide obsidian pillars lining the room on both sides, 15 ft tall obsidian statues of Phoenixes in the distance which overlooked a large platform where 50 or so crows were walking and fluttering about.

Ell teleported to the platform, sending the crows up in the air as she watched them begin to fly around one another and form a black and misty figure in the center of the room. The figure eventually formed long leather fingers with tight fitting leather armor for the chest, long black misty hair rising up into the air and also hanging down, and a polished porcelain mask with a black line down the middle.

She asked Ell why she had chosen the name "Corvus" since it wasn't her family name—finding it interesting that "Corvus" is another word used for the family of birds she just saw before her.

The figure mentioned that as some cultures believe the Crow or Raven acts as a Guide, she too is a guide for people lost, fragmented, and broken in this world. The Guide shared the following with Ell:

-   She came to this old world a lost, broken, and fragmented individual—remembering nothing about herself or how she came to be here
-   Over countless ages, she has managed to piece together elements of who she was, who she is, and what her purpose is; however, she seems to not have uncovered it all. She did not divulge to Ell how she pieced this information together.
-   She once was a regent of the ancient Elven Kingdom of Illefarn during the Age of Arcanum before the Calamity. During the Calamity, an ancient force some of her people referred to as "Tharizdun" (Illefarni for "Endless Nothing"), was stirred and began corrupting, twisting, and empowering many of the gods, who eventually became the betrayer gods. One of these corrupted gods, the goddess Lolth, known as the consort of Tharizdun, established a stronghold in the bowels of the earth where Illefarn was located. She began enticing and corrupting the elves of Illefarn with promises of untapped power and knowledge, drawing the weak, power hungry, and ambitious into her grasp. These devotees to Lolth called themselves the Children of Malice.
-   The Guide evacuated her people when she saw a war was brewing in the Illefarni kingdom and she and her people fled to an island they found far into the Trackless Sea which her people later named "Evermeet".
-   On the island of Evermeet, The Guide first encountered what she referred to as a beacon. A great light appeared to her at the location of this beacon ([[Sirin Beacons]], asked her what its name was, and she named it "Sirin", which roughly translated means "purposeful light".
-   The Sirin revealed much of the past, present, and future to her and revealed itself as the origin and source of all creation, vaguely referring to a cycle of trial and error enacted for its children to better themselves.
-   When it seemed as though the corruption would end everything, the [[Sirin]] saw the desperation of the [[ Prime Deities]], joining strengths with them to create large bright orange metallic rods carrying the essence of some of the deities and the Sirin mingled together, known as the [[Prime Trammels]]. These were necessary tools to perform the [[Rites of Prime Banishment]] to lock [[Tharizdun]] away long enough for the Sirin to remake the world anew in order to remove the memory of Tharizdun, seeing that as the only way to save creation from his corruption as it seemed the mere memory of him was enough of a seed to keep his presence alive.
-   The Rites of Prime Banishment were not fully successful. Several of the Prime Trammels were destroyed, sending shards of those Trammels throughout the world. Because [[Tharizdun]]'s essence had not been fully locked away, the Sirin [[consecuted]] the world to itself, and the destroyed it in order for it to be reborn. Instead it sundered the world into two worlds, neither of which were like the original and each bearing their own crippling deficiencies. The [[The Guide]] did not explain to Ell how this process worked or what she meant by "consecution". The Guide referred to this event as the "First Consummation".
-   The essence of Tharizdun feeds on Dunamis. Dunamis is the arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. These tethers have become to sever as Tharizdun's essence feeds on it, causing the planes to begin to merge into one another, resulting in the final annihilation of them all.
-   The Guide was the first practitioner of Dunamancy, the esoteric study of the nature of Dunamis and its threads through all schools of magic.
-   She has seen Teymir in her dreams and doesn't know who he is or why she's seeing him and 'not knowing' haunts her.
-   The [[Sirin Beacons]] have been lost to history but one of them she has discovered rests in the underground [[Valkurians]] vault under [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]].
- Recovering all the [[Sirin Beacons]] is key to restoring the Sirin and helping it understand its purpose, as well as being key to freeing [[Tanavast Adamantus]] from [[Tharizdun]]'s hands.
- Learned the following about [[Thay]] from [[Cassius Cromwell]]
	- Nation established by [[Drow]] during the end of the [[Calamity]]
	- Civil war broke out when nation was at peak power, [[War of Eight]]
		- [[Alina Baenre]] and [[Telamont Tanthul]]
	- he believes the current open war between your two empires is due to the Watchers possessing artifacts that are highly prized and sacred to the Thayans, metallic devices with powerful energy sources cut and molded into precise geometric shapes, which you recognized as likely being the same as the [[Sirin Beacons]]s Ell learned about from the [[The Guide]].
	- Cassius then ingested the stone and you all watched as he seemed to temporarily display supernatural strength and accuracy until his body seemed to begin to reject the foreign element inside him as he began writhing in pain. You learned that it seems the [[Everwatch Knights]] might likely be ingesting these stones, having found a small pouch of them on [[Captain William Acox]] and piecing together effects you also saw in his body.
- [[Elleanna Corvus]] kills [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] in the [[Mere of Dead Men]] caves and manages to conceal her culpability from everyone else when they find his body.
- Fight more [[Darkweave]] touched creatures in the caves as you learn it seems to take over the body and mind in stages
- Fought the [[Retriever]] and saved [[Cassius Cromwell]] and his family
- Come across a mechanical docent named [[Lyra]] in the caves who lead party to [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]'s ship the [[Paramount]]
	- Find yellow skinned humanoid creature strapped to table named [[Zera]], a [[Githzerai]]. As [[Teymir]] gets close he's teleported away. Comes back out with long beard, seemingly 5 years older
		- Lyra told you that Zera’s people, the [[Githyanki]], were after him for undisclosed reasons. It seems a rift had been created between the Githyanki and [[Githzerai]] that [[Zera]] had some hand in creating or influencing. In order to protect Zera from falling into the hands of the Githyanki, [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] found a way to travel into the [[Transitory Plane]] from somewhere in the material universe.
		- However, Ainsley did not fully understand the nature of this mysterious plane, which seemed to be a hub of sorts to other dimensional spaces and was filled with all manner of unknowable creatures that did not behave or communicate like anything Ainsley or his crew had encountered in their travels. While there, Ainsley and the crew discovered the [[Transitory Plane]] contained colonies of Githyanki, native to the material universe but were not able to determine why they were there as they kept distant from them to protect Zera.
		- Soon after the crew arrived, there was what Lyra could only describe as a storm of sorts as the silvery sky began to thrumb, darkness enveloped the crew for several minutes as Zera seemed to become paralyzed and exhibit other strange symptoms. Once the phenomena passed, the crew discovered Zera to be afflicted with some sort of strange malady, causing his yellowish-green skin to turn black as he began reporting hearing voices and gradually began to lose control of his psionic abilities sending uncontrolled bursts out from his body and putting the ship in severe danger. Seeing his crew in imminent danger, Ainsley traveled back to the material plane at a location distant from the Githyanki and began researching Zera’s malady.
		- Once back on the material plane, Zera seemed to be able to “hold back” the malady from taking over his body and mind further with his own psionic abilities somehow so the crew placed Zera in an isolation chamber in the ship’s Infirmary to allow him to come to a suspended state of consciousness in order to devote his full psionic abilities to staving off the malady. Lyra also told you that during his research, Ainsley discovered that Toril was also afflicted with a similar malady and he had come to Toril in order to learn more about it and how he could cure Zera.
		- [[Lyra]] shared he is currently infected by a dangerous and uncatalogued malady and is currently in a sensory deprivation chamber in the infirmary to allow him to use his unnatural psionic abilities to hold the malady at bay. Lyra stated that it's of the utmost importance that he remains in this state of sensory deprivation; otherwise, the malady could overtake his body which would be "devastating for your planet."
		- Party repaired [[Blueshift]] fuel leak
- Find submarine on [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]s ship and disembark for [[Thornhold]]
- [[Teymir]] notices his senses are incredibly heightened, hearing quiet sounds like they were booming from loudspeakers. He also discovered an exponentially heightened intelligence and wisdom while all other attributes were suppressed by them. He discovered he could solve complex quantum equations, read and retain information at a rapid pace, and perform other feats not natural to him. He discovered that even using magic that had any telepathic or mental component began volatile and dangerous as he attempted a Message spell with both Azure and Ell, both of whom were thrown back against the wall
- Teymir leaves recording on [[Paramount]]
	- In the message, he shared his name, mentioned the Blueshift leak had been repaired, the Biology Lab sealed, that your party had taken one of the distress beacons on the ship, and he mentioned the danger surrounding Zera and the Infirmary.
- [[Lyra]] triangulates [[Mary Emsworth]]s location to the city of [[Luskan]]
- Party views [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]s memory device given to [[Lyra]] in the [[Engineering Lab]] and find out [[Elleanna Corvus]] killed him.
	- An escalating confrontation immediately ensued as Azure and Teymir confronted Ell, Vos taking a position of getting everyone off the ship before addressing this but instead getting temporarily pulled into a confrontation with Azure as guns were drawn, Vos and Ell both were paralyzed and tied up and Azure gaining control of Vos’ new plasma shotgun and pistols before replacing them back near his paralyzed and restrained body and telling Vos that he wants to be able to trust him.

		Bound and gagged, the party led Ell to the underwater vessel in the cargo bay to depart the ship.
		
		A more intense confrontation began with the party and Ell in the underwater vessel as it detached from the ship and ROMA began autopiloting it on a course for Thornhold. Before removing her gag, Teymir threatened that if she attempted any magic or didn’t give every detail the party would put her down.
		
		Ell began to explain that Galladon had threatened that he would kill the entire party if they became privy to the information that Ainsley had. Therefore, in order to save the party she had to kill Ainsley before he could relay that information to you. Once she finished her explanation and the situation began de-escalating some, Teymir realized with his very high insight, brought about by the unnatural phenomena he encountered in the Infirmary, that Ell had been lying during her whole explanation. He then slammed her up against the wall, flanked by Azure who pointed a gun at her head. A stark coldness then came over Ell as the weeping, frail, and scared girl disappeared--revealing much of that persona to be a masterful subterfuge.
		
		Believing her relationship with Teymir to be at its end and likely her life, the fear in her face seemed to drain as she told Teymir that she killed Ainsley for her and Galladon had nothing to do with it, at which point Teymir looked to Azure and said, “Do whatever you want with her.” Azure then lit his sword with dark green flames, pressing it into Ell’s neck as she willingly offered it to him. He then opened his book, flipping through it and looking for a reason not to kill her. After many consecutive blank pages, he turned to one page showing a sketch of his lost love’s face which he recognized as the look on her face the day he left. After closing the book, he looked down at Ell and said, “Your father was a better friend than you’ll ever be. I owe him this much,” as he removed his flaming sword from her neck, replacing her gag, and sitting down opposite her as necrotic tears began to stream down his face and hiss as they each hit the metal floor beneath him.

		Ell continued periodic tense conversations with [[Teymir]], telling him that she would rather be out from under [[Galladon]]’s service, Teymir responding that Galladon is more predictable and, therefore, more trustworthy than Ell is at this point.

		Ell shared more about why she was sent to the group in the first place, mentioning that Teymir was an “easy mark” because of his willingness to trust and desire to have loyalty with others.

		Ell told him that she would likely have to kill again to advanced Galladon’s goals and to become more powerful in order to save her father. Teymir warned her that she would never be powerful enough on her own to save her father. Instead, he conveyed to her that power lies in the group around her and who you can trust. He told her that the more she killed, the more power she was giving up. Teymir concluded by telling her “we’ll get him back” and Ell telling Teymir that she would try and be the person he thinks she can be and Teymir telling her she needs to decide who she’s going to be.

		Teymir and Azure then spoke privately concerning Ell. Azure told Teymir not to let this betrayal of Ell’s make him bitter. He told Teymir the world is screwed up enough without people like Teymir wanting to see their friends dead. Azure told Teymir that if he learns anything from him, he should learn how not to be anything like Azure. They then discussed what the party should do with Ell, Azure mentioning they only had two choices--trust her somehow or kill her in her sleep. However, Azure mentioned that for the time being it appears that they need her and Teymir doesn’t need to be associated with or become the kind of person that would kill a young woman in her sleep. Azure told Teymir that he would need to learn when he’s being stupid and when he’s not. If he decides to be stupid with Ell, he’ll have to live with the consequences. He concluded by telling Teymir that he wouldn’t kill someone Teymir’s care about unless he knew that was something Teymir wanted. The decision is up to Teymir for better or worse.

- [[Teymir]] takes watch in the submarine
	- As Teymir took his watch and the ambience around him quieted, he began to feel a building potential energy all around him as he felt a sudden piercing pain in his head, heard the now familiar buzzing of a fly, and saw a physical fly land on his hand. Time and space seemed to grind and slow all around him as he looked down as his hand again and saw a dark gray hand bejeweled by various rings all bearing different geometric shapes.

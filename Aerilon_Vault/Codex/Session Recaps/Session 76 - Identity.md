After an intense confrontation with [[Elleanna Corvus]] and the party began to conclude, [[Yang Tieh]] began to speak to Ell for the first time since the party’s discovery regarding her murder of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]. Yang shared that he was the one who saw her father die. He mentioned that [[Tanavast Adamantus]] made a foolish choice to walk back into a room with a highly dangerous and unknown foe, telling Yang and [[John Smith]] to shut the way behind him. Ell seethed with anger as Yang bluntly discussed his last encounter with her father.

Ell continued periodic tense conversations with [[Teymir]], telling him that she would rather be out from under [[Galladon]]’s service, Teymir responding that Galladon is more predictable and, therefore, more trustworthy than Ell is at this point. Ell shared more about why she was sent to the group in the first place, mentioning that Teymir was an “easy mark” because of his willingness to trust and desire to have loyalty with others. In spite of this part of him making him an easy mark, Teymir responded that he’s not going to give in and be like so many others who always have an angle. Being honest with Teymir, Ell told him that she would likely have to kill again to advanced Galladon’s goals and to become more powerful in order to save her father. Teymir warned her that she would never be powerful enough on her own to save her father. Instead, he conveyed to her that power lies in the group around her and who you can trust. He told her that the more she killed, the more power she was giving up. Teymir concluded by telling her “we’ll get him back” and Ell telling Teymir that she would try and be the person he thinks she can be and Teymir telling her she needs to decide who she’s going to be.

Teymir and Azure then spoke privately concerning [[Elleanna Corvus]]. [[Azure Flint]] told Teymir not to let this betrayal of Ell’s make him bitter. He told Teymir the world is screwed up enough without people like Teymir wanting to see their friends dead. Azure told [[Teymir]] that if he learns anything from him, he should learn how not to be anything like Azure. They then discussed what the party should do with Ell, [[Azure Flint]] mentioning they only had two choices--trust her somehow or kill her in her sleep. However, Azure mentioned that for the time being it appears that they need her and Teymir doesn’t need to be associated with or become the kind of person that would kill a young woman in her sleep. Azure told Teymir that he would need to learn when he’s being stupid and when he’s not. If he decides to be stupid with Ell, he’ll have to live with the consequences. He concluded by telling Teymir that he wouldn’t kill someone Teymir’s care about unless he knew that was something Teymir wanted. The decision is up to Teymir for better or worse.

The group began their night watches, [[Gerard Vos]] watching as spiders began to crawl up the glass window of the underwater vessel, feeling an increasing sense of foreboding. As Teymir took his watch and the ambience around him quieted, he began to feel a building potential energy all around him as he felt a sudden piercing pain in his head, heard the now familiar buzzing of a fly, and saw a physical fly land on his hand. Time and space seemed to grind and slow all around him as he looked down as his hand again and saw a dark gray hand bejeweled by various rings all bearing different geometric shapes. A scene before him unfolded as described in [[Teymir's Lecture Room Vision]].

After the vision ended and Teymir fell out of his chair in shock, he and Azure tried to piece together what had occurred. They discovered from Lyra that the fly, still buzzing around the inside of the pod, was 1500 years old.

Yang then took his watch when Lyra told him that the meteorological anomaly could no longer be detected as the electrical systems of the pod began to fail as Azure and Ell began to erratically attempt to escape the pod through the hatch. Teymir and Yang managed to successfully wrestle them to the ground and prevent their escape. Lyra began to communicate that the ship's systems had been damaged by something potent and seemingly electromagnetic. Jolts of electrically began periodically coursing through the pod, damaging the party at various intervals. Vos and Yang managed to deploy the pod’s manual flotation system to cause the pod to surface. Meanwhile, Azure watched out of the front viewport of the pod as 4 large black tentacles wrapped over the glass, and Azure began to communicate with a creature which seemed to have grabbed onto the ship.

The creature began to demand an offering, indicating that it wanted the ship after Azure spoke with it a few moments. He managed to persuade the creature to allow the party to surface and come to your destination before acquiring the vessel. The creature agreed and said that it would accompany you to your destination.

And that’s where we pick up...

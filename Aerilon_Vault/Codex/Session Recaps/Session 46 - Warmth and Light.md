#recap 
# Last we left off...
Your party had just landed on the surface of the mysterious floating island in the[[ Moon Pass]] of the [[Nether Mountains]]. You began exploring the island making your way north down the middle of the island. You stopped first at a series of living quarters of some kind that several of you investigated. You found a series of layered scratches on the floors, walls, and ceiling. The rooms were small and each had a bed, table, and trunk all made of metal salvage from the crashed vessel. [[Elleanna Corvus]] found one room where "[[The Beginning is Ending]]" was written on the wall next to the bed in a language she couldn't read but was able to translate using the mechanical armor. You also found several rooms containing drawings the layout of the island, some of which had arrows pointing to various places on the island--the base of the spire, the control toward at the top of the spire, and a smaller floating island behind the spire. You also found a series of what appeared to be small keepsake items in various trunks in each room--children's toys, old photos, sweaters, etc.

While standing watch, [[John Smith]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]] heard the sound of gibbering and whispering coming from the north. They both hid behind one of the living quarter buildings and waited as a aberrant creature walked into the barracks area with a 10ft long fleshly arm reaching out of its stomach, gripping the ground and pulling it forward as it shuffled and continue murmuring and gibbering. Its skin was grayish blue and all over its body were gibbering mouths opening and closing independently of one another. Robinson and John watched as one creature reached its long arm onto the face of a deceased blue [[Draconic]] figure and began twisting and distorting that creature to look like itself and was able to reanimate the Draconic creature while doing so. The gibbering of the two creatures pierced into John's mind as he found himself attacking Robinson and then running directly into the side of one of the living quarters buildings. You were able to kill both creatures and then made your way to the spire in the middle of the island.

In the spire you saw a cathedral style room 300ft long covered in dead Draconic bodies overlaid by the same gibbering flesh full of mouths and eyes. You saw a figure at the end of the room sitting in a twisted silver chair laying motionless. Through inspecting his body through [[Rushnaa]]'s eyes, [[Teymir]] could see the body was mostly machine but had once been a [[Hobgoblin]] Draconic creature. You decided to close the doors to the spire and continued around the spire's east end.

You came to a smaller floating island separated by a 50ft gap where you found piles of salvaged material, including larger orange crystals and [[Kwalish Tanthul]]'s journal.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] and Robinson found what appeared to have once been a medical station with blue Draconic bodies in various states of transformation to machine. Yang found an energy cell in the back of the head of one of the bodies.

Teymir managed to pick into the lock system of Kwalish's journal and found a picture of [[Klovag]] in the front along with a Hobgolin woman and two boys. At the top of the journal read, "Kwalish Thultanthar, School of Artifice. [[Thultanthar]] enclave," followed by a series of revelations as Teymir read on.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦.

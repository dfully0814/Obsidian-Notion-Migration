#recap 
# Last we left off...
Black smoke billowed from a large tunnel [[Teymir]] blew into the east wall of [[Phandalin]] as a large group of citizens including [[Azure Flint]] and his close friend [[Halia Thornton]] ventured toward the tunnel to escape the city along with a unit of [[Everwatch Knights]] lead by [[Captain William Acox]].

When the group slowly crawled through the tunnel and out the other side the knights grouped everyone together near the east wall of the city. Azure briefly interacted with Captain Acox, noticing a slight tremor in his left hand and thinking he was injured, offered the captain aid several times which he repeatedly deferred.

Azure began to try and console Halia, who had just seen her home overrun with unnatural violence and gore in a matter of moments. When Halia probed Azure regarding what it is he lives and fights for, Azure replied, "I don't know."

Seeing a large number of injuries throughout the group of citizens of varying degrees of severity, Azure took out his lyre and began playing a soothing melody that began to ease the pain of the injuries of all those within earshot, many seeing severe injuries to their bodies begin to heal as they watched. Seeing this, Captain Acox asked Azure if he was a performer in the Sea Maiden's Faire, to which Azure replied, saying that he just enjoyed music.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Gerard Vos]] exited the south gate of the city, seeing a mob begin to form with a few of the louder voices shouting, "They're supposed to protect us! Is this protection? We'll protect ourselves!" Yang and Vos began to venture into a large patch of forest outside the wall where they soon met up with [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] who are already made their way there and were watching the events unfold with Azure and Halia's group.

Determining that they would soon need to escape the oversight of the [[Everwatchers]], Azure began to formulate a plan of how they could escape unnoticed. He created the illusion of the same haunting moaning that originally came from the demonic creature in the city and made its origin a distant patch of forest from the group's location. He then caused the knights armor, with the exception of Captain Acox, to very slowly begin to malfunction, causing their helmets to tighten around their necks slow enough where they wouldn't immediately think they were being attacked. With the sudden sound of moaning once again, the crowd was thrown into a panic while Captain Acox sent the four knights of his unit to investigate the sound in order to protect the citizens, watching from a distance as the knights began to clutch their throats gasping for air, leading the captain to belief the creature had surfaced again and was killing the four knights.

In the midst of the panic, Azure convinced the captain to escape with him and others in his group back into the forest along with many of the panicked citizens. Some of your group mounted on your two remaining horses, others walking on the ground, and you set foot away from Phandalin with Captain Acox now reluctantly accompanying you and leaving his men and group of Phandalin citizens behind.

As you began traveling, Vos began to lean forward on the horse carrying him, showing clear signs of his body being wracked with painful injuries from facing the ravenous hordes of frenzied citizens a few moments ago. Captain Acox briefly remarked with anger and frustration, saying "I told the Marshall he never should've let that damned festival happen." At one point, Azure offered him a healing potion, which he first asked Azure to drink to ensure it wasn't harmful. He then took a small sip, looked up at Vos, and said, "Looks like he needs this more than I do."

You then arrived at a mining cave that Captain Acox directed you to where you could rest and gather yourselves. He told you that he planned to lead you to a local garrison in the small city of [[Leilon]] the next day. Deciding fairly quickly that you weren't willing to accompany him to a local garrison after the tragic event you just witnessed, Azure and Teymir began to discuss what you might do to avoid accompanying him.

You arrived to the cave, made a fire, and Yang began to cook soup to feed everyone. Teymir approached Halia with a bowl of soup and began talking to her. She expressed a distrust in him, mentioned she's been through a lot with Azure over the years, eventually discovered that Teymir was also a member of the [[Valkurians]], and then began to talk some about Phandalin. She expressed that she's not necessarily a fan of the Everwatchers but seeing what just happened to her home, she understands why they do what they do. She also mentioned that if the Watchers search her home they're going to find all sorts of illegal contraband and so she is going to have to find some money and then find a way to disappear. She mentioned knowing a Valkurian near Phandalin who can help her disappear if she gets the money. Teymir assumed she was referring to mutual acquaintance [[Tamerland Quixat]].

Azure and Captain Acox meanwhile got acquainted more as the captain began talking about his love for the sea where he once served in the empire's navy as an officer. He also expressed his deep regret of the evenings events, telling Azure at one point, "I'll never forgive myself—that my men died and I didn't." Azure continued attempting to try and relieve him of the heavy burden he seemed to be carrying, noticing again the tremor in his hand on occasion and his repeated drinking throughout the conversation.

Once everyone began to lay down to rest, Azure waited until everyone, including Captain Acox, had fallen asleep. He then woke Teymir up and said, "If we're gonna do this now's the time." Azure then cast Hold Person on the captain, sensing a stronger resistance to it than normal, and successfully paralyzed the captain. As the captain awoke, Teymir then began pulling off his armor while Azure began to try and reason with him by telling him that the group didn't mean him any harm but that you couldn't accompany him to Leilon. With the captain still paralyzed, and believing the hold person to be quickly expiring, Teymir transformed the stone and rock around the captain's body, pulling him into the ground, and forming around him—effectively locking him in place as the hold person wore off.

Seeing the stone magically molded around him as he was conscious, the captain looked at his sword lying on the ground then to Azure, then at Teymir and said, "You owe me at least one thing. When you do it, do it clean." Auzure and Teymir began to try and convince the captain that they didn't mean him any harm. The captain became incense and mentioned about how dangerous magic was to the realm and how all he wants is for the realm to be safe. Azure then countered him and confronted him by telling him about John Smith, who wasn't protected but mercilessly killed when he tried to escape from a group of knights. Captain Acox leaned in closely to Azure, saying "Well then, he deserved it." At this point Teymir ran over to the captain, pulled his laser pistol and shot the captain through the head.

In the pregnant silence that followed, Halia—who had been sitting up against the opposite cave wall during the exchange—looked over to Azure and then to Teymir and said, "Azure, if you plan to endear yourself to the Watchers, you'll have to reign in little tricks like that."

And that's where we pick up...

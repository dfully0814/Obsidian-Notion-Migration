#recap 
# Last we left off...

The party entered a dark and muddy octagonal room where [[Teymir]] saw a crustacean-like creature patrolling around what appeared to be a boulder structure in the middle of the room. In addition to the creature in the room, Teymir noticed a haziness to the room, lightly obscuring his otherwise clear vision in areas devoid of light. The rest of the party also witnessed their relative light sources begin to flicker and dim down to half their radiance as they entered the room. Teymir wasn't able to discern the nature of the haze but sense an oppressive nature to it. Keeping their distance from the creature and staying near the doors, Teymir took out a tentacled statue he took from the first room the party entered to show them that it resembled the creature he could see in the room. Seeing the stolen statue in Teymir's hands, one of the creatures confronted him, telling him and the rest of the party to put back what they had taken. Having put down the gold and statue, Teymir attempted to negotiate with the creature and a second creature that had now revealed itself by uncoiling from the boulder-like structure in the middle of the room which the party realized was the creature's skin.

The creatures offered to tell [[Teymir]] a secret in exchange for returning the stolen gold and statue. Teymir asked, "Who am I?" The creatures responded, "You are us" as Teymir watched two dark incorporeal spirits rise out of the bodies of the tentacled creatures, and what looked like hundreds of dark spirits appeared and disappeared in the dark haze. In response to Teymir's negotiation, the creature telepathically spoke to him and told him to present an offering in order to safely pass and then pointed to Teymir and told him to present an offering in order to safely pass and then pointed to [[Leowin Moonflower]] who the party noticed was passed out on the ground behind them. The party quickly prepared for combat as Teymir fired an eldritch blast beam into each of the dark spirits hovering above the now limp bodies of the tentacled creatures and combat began, the party watching as these spirits seem to periodically become this haze around them and then reappear again while also periodically taking refuge inside the bodies of the tentacled creatures and then leaving again.

One of the spirits bolted through the air toward the helpless [[Leowin Moonflower]] on the ground, forcing its way into her body. Panicked, Leowin told [[Tanavast Adamantus]] to get her out of the room, pointing to the eastern door inset into the wall that led deeper into the temple and telling Tanavast that "he" said the spell lenses were that way. Seeing the one dark spirit successfully invade Leowin's body, the second dark spirit disappeared back into the dark haze, leaving the party to decide what to do. While debating whether or not it was truly Leowin who was talking to them, [[Azure Flint]] pulled his sword, walked over, and brought it down on Leowin's back, causing a blinding arc of lightning to erupt from Leowin's body, travel into the metal of Azure's sword, into and out of his body, into Tanavast's armor, and then into Teymir, rendering Azure and Teymir unconscious and Tanavast within an inch of unconscious himself.

Enraged by Azure's apparent ruthlessness, Tanavast weakly made his way over to Leowin, who was now down on one knee, enveloped in smoke. Kicking Azure's body as the life slowly left him, Tanavast asked Leowin if she was okay, to which she replied "hit me again, Tanavast." Taken aback, and after making a difficult decision to accept her request, Tanavast raised his flail and brought it down on Leowin's head with radiant fury, causing a bright blast of blinding radiant light. Tanavast watched as Leowin, seemingly weakened, made her way back to her feet with blood dripping from her head. Having revived the Azure and Teymir the group began attacking Leowin in unison. Teymir fired two eldritch blasts, knocking Leowin up against the eastern wall of the room.

She responded by screaming in a panicked stricken tone, "KILL ME!!" She looked out across the group, and Azure, who was closest to her watched in the obscuring darkness as she seemed to reach into a pocket and begin rubbing her hands together. [[Teymir]] watched as she brought her hand up to her throat, grabbing it, and then subsequently toppling over limp on the ground, at which [[Azure Flint]] walked over, shining his light to the ground and seeing the poisoned jellyfish ring he had given her adorned on her finger. Detecting that the dark spirit's presence had left her body that now seemed to be empty of life, Teymir picked up [[Leowin Moonflower]]'s body and moved her to the flight of steps leading down north of the room. With a mix of emotions at what has transpired, you begin halfway down a flight of stone steps, a young girl, who is the reason most of you have found yourselves together and was connected to a power unlike anything you've seen, lies lifeless up against the wall.

# Last we left off...
The party was headed south on the [[Dawn Chaser]] en route to [[Waterdeep]] with **[[Leowin Moonflower]]** to complete their mission. While deliberating on a plan to more secretly enter the city with the girl and not simply hand her over to the [[Valkurians]], the crew encountered a mysterious ship coming from the south and headed north up the [[Sword Coast]]. The ship seemed to be piloted by a single individual, and the crew began hearing a voice in their heads telling the crew that he didn't meany any harm and was looking to help and that his name was Tanavast. **Captain Moonlight** cautiously brought the man onto the ship in manacles, to get more information regarding his business and motivation for helping.

Meanwhile, [[Azure Flint]] jumped onto [[Tanavast Adamantus]]'s ship that was anchored next to the [[Dawn Chaser]] and attempted to steal the ship along with [[John Smith]]. After being requested to bring [[Teymir]], **John Smith**, and **Azure** into her [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] quarters, [[Tog]] saw Tanavast's ship slowing lurching forward with **Azure** and **John Smith** aboard. After telling the captain what he saw, **Moonlight** ordered **Tog** to release **Tanavast** from the manacles, eagerly anticipating watching **Tanavast** try to reclaim his ship. The crew watched as **Tanavast** bounded toward his ship, making a running leap over the starboard side of the ship in full plate armor and landing successfully onto his ship, beginning a struggle between **Tanavast** and **Azure** for control of the ship.

After resisting a spell **Azure** used to try and paralyze **Tanavast**, **Tanavast** soon was able to knock **Azure** away from the helm of the ship and convince **Azure** to stand down. Meanwhile, **Teymir** began a conversation with [[Leowin Moonflower]], telling her that it's her choice whether or not they hand her over to the [[Valkurians]] and asking her what she wants to do. In response, she told **Teymir** she doesn't actually have a choice and neither do they. She went on to recount some of her past to **Teymir**.

She mentioned that she was taken from her home of [[Evermeet]] that was hidden from the rest of the world by powerful mages. When [[Karsus' Folly]] occurred and brought down the concealing magic around [[Evermeet]]. She said soon the [[Shadovar]] came who had seemingly already been searching for this place, kidnapped her and several other of her people and took them to a land called [[Laerkond]] where she saw it inhabited by many strange beasts. She then said that she was taken to a temple there and doesn't remember anything after that but now has an entity that seems to talk to her, guide her steps, and give her power. She concluded by telling [[Yang Tieh]] and **Teymir** that she would do whatever they thought was best.

The party then proceeded to board **Tanvast's** ship, leaving the crew of the **Dawn Chaser** to their own devices and proceeding south. The session ended as the party was determining how they wanted to approach [[Waterdeep]] with the girl and where they wanted to go. Everyone is aboard **Tanavasts's** unassuming and scarcely stocked ship in what is now around midnight as you know **Waterdeep** approaches ever quicker as the hours wane and you have a very important plan to finalizeâ€¦

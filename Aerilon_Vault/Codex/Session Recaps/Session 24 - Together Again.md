#recap 
# Last we left off...
The party began in two different areas of the underground temple. [[Azure Flint]] and [[Teymir]] began searching the dining room of the mountain structure they found themselves in, searching the various bodies lying dead at the dining room table. They noticed all the bodies and the room itself had seemingly been picked clean. The noble figures had no jewelry or trinkets on them. However, Teymir found a small note in the waistcoat pocket of one of the figures. He discovered it was a ransom note that read, "We have your daughter in [[Gloomwrought]], give us GP120 or she dies."

Teymir then looked out the left and right windows, seeing the faint glow of very distant lights through the frosted glass of the window and raging blizzard beyond. Intensely drawn to any possible relation that this might have to his past, Teymir grabbed a nearby chair and bashed open the right window, letting in the frigid mountain blizzard into the building. Placing both hands on each side of the window, he strained to remember if there was any relation between this area to anything in his past that he could remember. As he closed his eyes, he found himself transported to a 15ft wide sheet of ice floating in a black body of water with darkness all around. He saw the figure of a small girl in a white nightgown with long white hair coming toward him hovering along the water.

She started a conversation with him, asking "How did you do it?" Stunned to almost complete silence, [[Teymir]] asked her who she was to which she responded, "One step at a time. First, you need to discover who you are. There's a war coming. Be ready" at which point the vision suddenly ended and Teymir found himself back at the window, freezing at almost succumbing to the below zero temperatures. After they both crossed over into the forest, Teymir and [[Azure Flint]] interacted about Teymir's pursuit of his past. Azure once again warned Teymir that he believed Teymir's passionate pursuit of his past were going to get other people hurt and cause pain.

He also told Teymir that at the end of the day he was going to be who he is now and his past wouldn't change or influence that. Teymir responded by telling Azure that he wasn't going to stop. Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[John Smith]] continued their interaction with the tribal chieftain down in the temple. The chieftain began telling Yang and John that "[[Kisin]] would protect [[Kaya]] and Kaya would protect them". He told Yang that he sensed Yang had a strong spirit and that Kaya had a strong spirit as well. The chieftain then proceeded to cut his own throat with a flint knife, letting black liquid drip from his neck into a clay pot, which Yang later realized had been emptied.

John and Yang soon came face to face with a large tiger with deep blue eyes, which suddenly attacked Yang revealing to him that the tribal bracers on his arms would provide protection for him temporarily. Yang and John realized this was Kaya and Yang realized the tiger was pledging his loyalty to Yang as Kaya began its task of carrying the memory of his people forward into the world.

The party eventually met back in the tropical forested area of the [[Sword Coast]], being told by Azure that you seemed to have come out 100 miles or so north up the coast from where you entered the large hold in the ground into the temple initially. You guys have just awoken from a long and much-needed rest 1 mile or so from the beach as the sound of the distant waves rolls through the forest with the wind and you are deciding how to proceed forward.

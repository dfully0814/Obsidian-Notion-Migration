# Last we left off...
A month has passed since the time [[Robinson Fellweather]] and [[Yang Tieh]] escaped the mysterious island in the [[Whalebone Islands]]. You've learned that the empire of [[Aerilon]] has entered into full scale war with the eastern nation of Thay, one of the first significant battles taking place on the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], resulting in a significant defeat for the empire and resulting in the current occupation of the prosperous nation of [[Cormanthyr]] by the [[Thayan]] empire.

[[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Teymir]] arrived in the city of wealthy and shadowed city of [[Yartar]] to recruit a crew for an unknown job that will be sponsored by Teymir's friend [[Tamerland Quixat]], who has aided the two over the past month to fake their deaths and disappear from the eye of the [[Everwatchers]]. They arrived during the [[Hiring Faire]] in Yartar, a festival of sorts where skilled individuals congregate to make a name for themselves and be recruited for jobs such as the one Tamerland is sponsoring. As the two sat in the courtyard of the [[Waterbaron's Hall]], a large crowd began gathering for a duel in the main thoroughfare of the city. A voice came over what appeared to be a series of loudspeakers distributed throughout the city and began to introduce the participants, two of which included [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Azure Flint]].

Azure and Yang faced off against a half-Tiefling individual who appeared to be a skilled marksman and another individual who was more machine than man, wearing a cowboy hat and wielding a sabre and laser pistol. Yang and Azure managed to eventually defeat the two individuals, and their dead bodies continued to lie in the street as the crowd dispersed.

The group briefly became reacquainted over drinks and food at the Waterbaron's Hall, and Ell and Teymir then continued recruiting for Tamerland. Ell first met a half-elf woman with blond hair named [[Sell]] who managed to steal Teymir's staff without him noticing and also catch Ell before she could pickpocket Sell.

The two then met a man named [[Lochira]] who seemed arrogant and propositioned Ell but also seemed adept at speed. Teymir told him where the recruits would meet for further instructions. As they continued walking down the main thoroughfare, they saw two bodies thrown through a shop window nearby as a lightly blue skinned figure with short white hair, small curved horns, and black leathers jumped through the broken window and killed each figure on the group with retractable blades extending from her sleeves. She spoke in a gruff almost reptilian tone. Teymir challenged her to find a monk in the [[The Winter Winds]] with a 3 headed spear and asked her if she thought which of them would do more damage on the first hit in a fight. Before he could get out any other words, she disappeared.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦.

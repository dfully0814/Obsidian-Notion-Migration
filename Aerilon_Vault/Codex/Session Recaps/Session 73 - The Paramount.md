# Last we left off...
You began 100 feet deep in the sea 1 mile off the [[Sword Coast]] in the midst of a supernatural storm caused by what [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]'s docent [[Lyra]] indicated is likely due to extra-planar events near [[Thornhold]].

Using his ability to transform himself and swim and breath underwater, [[Teymir]] quickly made his way to Ainsley's sunken ship, which you later learned was named The [[Paramount]].

The rest of the party began together, having very limited visibility in ocean water heavily obscured by debris, silt, and occasionally dead bodies washing to the shore from shipwrecks farther out.

As you swam in the direction you saw Teymir go, you began to encounter strangely mutated sharks with tendrils of muscle hanging from their bodies, skin worn away in various places, and bone showing in various areas, in the water as the rest of you tried to find your way to the Paramount with 15ft of visibility around you.

You began to fight the sharks trying to skirt around them while Teymir began searching for you after a few moments, using Lyra to help triangulate your positions. As you managed to begin to kill some of the sharks, more were attracted to your location by the abundance of blood seeping into the ocean water.

You all managed to make it to the open hatch of the Paramount, some of you have taken a good amount of damage.

You made your way down a 20ft ladder into a 20x20ft room as Lyra communicated with the ship via her red beam and a red-colored lense in the ceiling of the room. Steel panels on three sides of the room lifted up, flushing all the water out of the room, pressurizing the room, and then you heard the sliding door on the other wall open.

You made your way inside the ship, immediately seeing a series of crew's quarters down a narrow hallway. Before investigating any of the rooms, you followed Lyra around a T intersection where you found the flight deck where you saw a large curved window dominating the far end of the room along with 5 chairs distributed throughout the room.

Lyra made her way over to what appeared to be a glass panel, began to communicate with it as you heard a voice ring out throughout the ship who you later learned was named [[ROMA]], an AI entity introducing itself as the caretaker of the ship.

Lyra immediately asked ROMA to confirm the containment of what she referred to as "the specimens". ROMA responded to say that specimen 136 remains contained but 134 and 135 are no longer contained due to critical damage in the [[Biology Lab]] where they are currently located.

You learned that these are specimens Ainsley came across at some point during his travels through the [[Transitory Plane]], which the crew managed to capture for ambiguous reasons. You also learned that another entity this place is currently being held in the [[Infirmary]]â€”a [[Githzerai]] named [[Zera]], who Lyra informed you is currently infected by a dangerous and uncatalogued malady and is currently in a sensory deprivation chamber in the infirmary to allow him to use his unnatural psionic abilities to hold the malady at bay. Lyra stated that it's of the utmost importance that he remains in this state of sensory deprivation; otherwise, the malady could overtake his body which would be "devastating for your planet."

Lyra also learned from ROMA that the experimental regenerative Blueshift fuel that powers the ship's engines and all its components is currently leaking out into the ocean and if the leak continues at its current rate, ROMA will be forced to direct the ship's power away from all systems into life support, thereby deactivating the security protocols keeping the creatures locked in the Biology Lab and the sensory deprivation protocols active in the Infirmary.

Meanwhile, [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to display how shaken she was having just been in the water for as long as she had. Seemingly shaken, she expressed wanting to take a walk around the ship, which the entire party vehemently disagreed with. You decided to help Lyra begin to repair the [[Blueshift]] leak in shifts, some of you watching Ell and others going to help Lyra.

You then made your way into the [[Cargo Bay]] where you saw a series of large steel shipping containers from which you obtained very aged and faded protective suits, repair guns, and a couple of plasma batteries which Lyra said you would need to temporarily bypass the Blueshift's connection to the ship's power in order to repair the leak.

And that's where we pick up...

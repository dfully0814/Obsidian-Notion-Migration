# Last we left off...
After meeting back together in butterfly garden of the [[Cassalanter Mountain Villa]], along with [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] went back into the guest house to find [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Yang Tieh]]. The party retraced their steps into a guest bedroom upstairs and through a hollowed out wardrobe closet into a series of stone corridors containing what appeared to be prison cells. You found [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] and [[Yang Tieh]] here.

[[Elleanna Corvus]] decided to kill one of the individuals you realized to be a [[House Cassalanter]] noble behind one of the prison cells in order to extract his memories to gain more information. After killing him, she had a vision of the villa during a light snowfall in the mountains during the day when a group of children were playing outside the villa as you watched through this individual's eyes. Ell then heard a female's voice call "Rancis, bring the children inside. It's time for lunch." Ell then watched as the family gathered around a long and unfamiliar decorated table. Ell then saw a blinding flash of green light and felt a incomprehensibly strong pull of gravitational force against the house as the green flash quickly went dark and the room was bathed in deep darkness.

In the darkness, she then began to hear the sounds of stabbing and death all around the room as some individuals barely managed to let out a scream before some unseen attacker silenced them. Rancis found the dining table, hid under it, and was soon found and knocked unconscious. 

The memory flashed to a seen of a throne room as Rancis was dragged by two [[Drow]] guards to the foot of a large throne with large black dragon wings fully extended from either side. On the throne sat [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]]. She looked down at Rancis and said, "Well. An outsider. You're going to be quite useful. Take him to the catacombs." At that point, the memory faded.

At this point, [[Yang Tieh]]'s spear began to pulse with a blue light from each of the gears where he has housed a primordial. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then heard a menacing female voice that said, "Ah. ah. That's mine." 

The party then ventured forward deeper into the stone corridors and soon came across what looked like a decorative but unkept study with dusty bookshelves all around and a large portrait displaying a Drow male with long black hair and noble female also with long black hair wearing a decorative crimson dress. The two were locking arms in a pristine pose. The plaque underneath read, "[[Rivalen Tanthul]] and [[Ammalia Cassalanter]]". 

This piqued the party's interest as you all sat down to better understand this connection along with everything you have discovered to this point. You began to speculate on how [[Rivalen Tanthul]] might be related to [[Telamont Tanthul]] but were unable to arrive at any definitive conclusion. You found mention in some of the books in the study of another notable member of the family by the name of [[Edmur Cassalanter (S)]] but weren't able to find any useful information about him other than that he was the first member of [[House Cassalanter]] natively born in [[Thay]] as a child of [[Rivalen Tanthul]] and [[Ammalia Cassalanter]]. You also discussed some about the nature of the [[Children of Malice]] and began speculating who from [[House Xorlarrin]] by be members or not.

The party then ventured back down the stone corridor in search of a potential stash of magic items housed here by [[Bertio Cassalanter]] and alluded to by his son [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]. On the way out, [[Gerard Vos]] suddenly felt a cold dull pain in his chest as he turned around to see a faceless shadow form with a sword plunged  into his chest.

And that's where we pick up....

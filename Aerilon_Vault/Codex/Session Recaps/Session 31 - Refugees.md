#recap 
# Last we left off...
The light of your next overcast morning in the [[Westwood Forest]] began as you awoke in your camp to witness the brutality of your previous evening all around you. In the light of the morning, you saw more clearly the bodies of men, women, and children bludgeoned, burned, cut from your attacks to defend Robinson's barrier from what you perceived to be either forced entry or consumption by these ravenous shells of human bodies that now lied before you.

The last to wake up, terrified and sickened by the gore around her, Jovi began walking around the 15 corpses surrounding the camp. Suddenly, you saw her rush to the body of one of the women lying on the ground. [[Jovi]] began to bury her face in the chest of the woman and began screaming and crying until there was nothing but exhaustion and grief outlasting her physical ability to express it. After discovering this to be Jovi's mother, you decided together to honor her mother with a proper burial. You constructed a small pyre for burning her body while Jovi collected flowers from the forest floor that she said her mother always loved, placing them in between her mother's hands as she lay on the pyre.

As you all stood around the body waiting for rites or words to be spoken, Jovi said almost under her breath, "You promised you would come back. You didn't," at which point she turned around and began to walk away before being approached by [[Teymir]] and persuaded to return back to the body, convincing her that she still had control over how she sent her mother away but would not if she left it like this, drawing on his own longing of not having many of his own memories.

Jovi walked back and thanked her mother before lighting the pyre using a glyph from [[Robinson Fellweather]]. The two stood side by side as Jovi watched the pyre slowly consumed in flame, the flickering flames dancing in her grieved eyes.

You then set out across the [[Dessarin Valley]] toward [[Amphail]]. As you approached the town, Teymir sent [[Rushnaa]] to scout ahead. You discovered that there was a [[Everwatch Knights]] checkpoint at the north and south ends of the town, as well as 15 guards that Rushnaa could count walking the streets from a quick fly over, but you assumed there were likely more than that. She described seeing the regularly dressed Everwatch Knights with the teal sashes and skirts as well as larger figures with heavier looking armor, crimson plumes sticking up from their full faced helmets, and red and gold caplets draped across one shoulder and hanging down, as well as hanging red and gold sashes around the waist.

Determining it not to be safe to bring magic items into the town, [[Teymir]] began searching for a boulder in which to stash everyone's magic items. Finding large boulders to be scarce in this area, Teymir traveled about an hour away from the party's location before finding a boulder large enough. While casting a spell to open the boulder's interior using his magic ring, Teymir was attacked by a tall half-orc bounty hunter named [[Ziraj]], resulting in an intense face to face melee, Teymir watching as Ziraj seemed to possess the ability to negate some of his magical abilities and fire a volley of glowing arrows simultaneously.

Through some in-combat dialogue, Teymir discovered that Ziraj was paid by the [[Everwatchers]] to roam the Dessarin Valley and hunt apostates, bringing them in dead or alive depending on the bounty. He stated that apostates were particularly valuable and did not seem to intend to bring Teymir in alive until he noticed a tattoo design on Teymir's arm, causing his countenance to suddenly change as he began apologizing for accidentally mistaking Teymir as an apostate. He referred to Teymir as a scourger as said that he didn't want any trouble with the Everwatchers. As Teymir seemed to deny affiliation with them, he asked Teymir if he was a defector, warning him that if it was this easy to find him, it would certainly be easy for the Everwatchers to do so. Ziraj ended the conversation and walked back in the direction of the Westwood Forest.

The party soon rejoined on a hill overlooking [[Amphail]], deciding to present yourselves as refugees from Kheldell in search of refuge after the attack on the town. You made your way to the checkpoint before being stopped 1,000 ft. from the entrance and heavily scrutinized by a group of Everwatch Knights, asking your business, where you are coming from, where you're going, etc. Some of you describe being from [[Waterdeep]], [[Thornhold]], and several locations that seem to have either been at the center or related in some way to destruction over the past 2 weeks, causing the guards to become very suspicious of you.

Seeing Jovi's grieved demeanor, one of the knights brushed her face, compassionately stating, "Dear child, what horrors you must have seen," before ordering another knight to take her inside. The decision regarding what to do about you came down to how much Jovi trusted you as the knight looked down to her and asked "Do you trust these men," to which she replied somewhat half-heartedly but enough for convincing, "They've kept me safe."

You were allowed to walk up to the large wooden doors of the city as one of the crimson plumed guards walked up to each of you, passing a glowing orb over both of your hands and ordering you through one by one. You then entered your first civilized area as a party and the first populated area for Teymir in over 2 weeks.

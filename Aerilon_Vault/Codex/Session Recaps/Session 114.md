#recap 
# Last we left off...

You continued your travels through the mountains regions of the northern area between [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]] where your party, continuing to be lead by [[Thryn]] encamped for the evening once again in the mountains--one day removed from your arrival to [[Luskan]] and the [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]]'s performance of [[The Investiture]]. 

You separated into separate watches for the evening. [[Teymir]], [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], and [[Murlough Grahlund]] discussed the path ahead when [[Murlough Grahlund]] share his intention to continue traveling with you to aid [[Gerard Vos]] and maybe also find out more information regarding who was hunting [[House Grahlund]] and even the possible whereabouts of [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]], who assassinated the elder brother of [[House Grahlund]], [[Alas Grahlund]]. He also shared that he doesn't know yet what to do about [[Ethes Grahlund]] and who he has become involved with in the [[Valkurians]] to set up this train ambush. He asked [[Teymir]] if anyone from the [[Valkurians]] would possibly be looking for [[Ethes Grahlund]] to kill him and [[Teymir]] shared that he didn't think so since for all intents and purposes the [[Valkurians]] provided for [[Ethes Grahlund]] what they had agreed upon, and much more than that without [[Ethes Grahlund]]'s knowledge of the full scope of the purpose and machinations behind the ambush.

[[Teymir]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] then discussed that it seems [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] is able to remember less and less of his time in [[Nulmoria]], almost like the fading details of a dream after time passes. 

The next day you traveled for most of the day when you came to the edge of a tall mountain overlooking a valley that met an ocean harbor in the distance--the city of [[Luskan]]. [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] lead everyone back into the woods into a clearing where he began [[The Investiture]] after discussing what would happen with [[Teymir]] privately. You watched as he drew the symbol of the [[Everwatch Knights]] into the ground and the ground began to glow and radiate heat both from it and the commander. The commander then prayed audibly to [[Helm]], handed his sword over to [[Teymir]]. [[Teymir]] then announced the commander's bravery to the group standing around watching the scene.

As [[Teymir]] raised the sword, [[Elleanna Corvus]] watched as reality around her began to fold in on itself and the area of [[Luskan]] began a massive floating city exhibiting a dull green energy, while the snow around her became ash. The party began dissolute and formless like looking through an ashen veil at them as time seemed to drastically slow. In the distance, [[Elleanna Corvus]] saw a shadowed and formless creature with large wings whose body was filled with stars like a galaxy creating its form. The creature didn't seem to acknowledge [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s  presence as it began to rush forward in the air toward [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]]'s location where the commander's body, while on his knees, began to physically coalesce into this ashen space where [[Elleanna Corvus]] was while all the other figures of the party remained formless. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then watched as hundreds of tiny orange motes of energy began to rise off of the commander's body like embers from a fire, which the starry creature seemed ravenously intent on consuming. [[Elleanna Corvus]] attempted to teleport herself, the commander, and the creature away from the spot, but was unsuccessful in teleporting the creature.

She then attempted to revive the commander, noticing that his form appeared to be more of an illusion that she couldn't directly interact with. While interacting with his form, the creature consumed all the motes of orange energy that the command left behind. Once consumed, shadow began to swirl around the creature's form as hundreds more green orbs with memories inside of them began to pop off from the creature's body. Soon, an armored, cloaked, menacing form stood before [[Elleanna Corvus]] wielding a heavy sword. She then suddenly heard the whispered and desperate voice of her father should "Run!". Thinking quickly, she consumed as many of the memory orbs as she could, sending her vision solid white and expelling her chaotically forward through time and space and planting her back in the snowy area near [[Luskan]] as she watched [[Teymir]] seconds later bring down the large greatsword on the commander's neck.

She quickly ran up to [[Teymir]] to try and tell him what happened when [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] quickly ran up also asking what the trouble was. [[Elleanna Corvus]] began to implore [[Teymir]] and [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] that you needed to leave while [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] argued that you couldn't leave the commander behind for the wild dogs and other scavengers. [[Teymir]] agreed with [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] and offered to stay behind and help bury the commander.

And that's where we pick up...

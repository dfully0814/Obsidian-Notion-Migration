# Last we left off...
As your morning began in the [[Stone Stallion]], [[Elleanna Corvus]] was quickly reminded of the steadily increasing amounts of pain she has endured over the past day or so as she began pleading with [[Robinson Fellweather]] to make her a medicinal remedy of some kind that would numb her main, even temporarily. Taking some of his stash of the herbal drug known as "shorty" he broke up a small portion of it and mixed it with a morning tea ordered from the kitchen downstairs. This drug seemed to temporarily relieve Ell's pain without causing her to completely lose her awareness and faculties.

As you were discussing your next steps, you heard the heavy footsteps of a soldier of the [[Everwatch Knights]] making his way to Mr. [[Aiden Zatchet]]'s office, eventually coming to your door and telling you that your presence was requested at the Knight Headquarters in the town center, located in a large communication building for courier and messaging services for the people of [[Amphail]]. He told you that [[Captain Roland Royston]] would see you there at 2:00pm.

Robinson and [[Teymir]] then made their way to Aiden Zatchet's office to speak with him about his proposal regarding how he could help Ell. After showing off his pristine top-hate behind a clear glass case, he shared with you that [[Marge]] had been sold into the service of a man he referred to as a "brigand" named [[Captain Riffolk Salte]], who captains a ship named the [[Fortunate Son]], which he told you is known as a vessel often spoken of in the slave trade and illegal smuggling of slaves up and down the [[Sword Coast]]. He mentioned that Salte is in the employ of a man far worse than himself, the name of whom he didn't know and told you that from what he has heard of his employer, you would likely need back up if you were to ever run a foul of this employer. He told you that he has a business relationship with [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] who he could put you in touch with should you desire her aid in locating Salte. He mentioned that she has some vested interest in finding him as well as you remember her mentioning that the Fortunate Son was the ship upon which her father served at one point in time. Vehemently, Teymir rejected this offer as the majority of the party seemed undecided regarding their feelings on her involvement. Zatchet also mentioned that Salte often makes port in the town of [[Thornhold]], although he is not sure when he will make port again. He gave you a communicator he said would allow you to communicate with him and he you once every day. He told you that he could have informants monitor the nearby ports and inform him the next Salte made port. You told him you would consider this.

You also mentioned to Zatchet about your 2:00pm meeting with the [[Everwatch Knights]]. He cautioned you not to be late. He also asked you to come back by his office before you went to the meeting when you asked him if there was anything he could do to help you during that meeting since you were not somewhat of an asset to him.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] awoke in the [[Stag-Horned Flagon]], [[Sarah Roaringhorn]] not anywhere in sight. He conversed with the owner of the Flagon, named [[Jocelyn Phylund]], who seemed to have skin that had lost most of its normal pigmentation, had a dried out look, as well as a glassy right eye. Yang tried to probe Jocelyn for information that he quickly became aware was of a potentially illegal nature, to which Phylund abruptly asked Yang to leave the Flagon, stating that he has established Flag to build an upstanding name for his family and wants no part in anything illegal. He mentioned to Yang that if it was trouble he was looking for, he would find plenty at the Stone Stallion with Aiden Zatchet.

Teymir, Robinson, and [[John Smith]] then went out into town on a shopping trip. John Smith and Teymir made their way to [[Evelyn's General Store]], an up-scale pawn shop run by an ebony-skinned woman with black dreadlocks and moon-shaped jewelry all over her body named [[Mary Emsworth]]. After seeing Teymir pay for some of the cost of John's thieves tools, she stated "I heard you were an honorable man," at which point she indicated she had been waiting for you all. She lead Teymir and John down several flights of stairs into a futuristic room where you saw floating orbs and holographic map-like images displaying from them. Her store hand, whom she introduced as [[Tick-Clack]] began to play an audio message from [[Captain Alford Ainsley]].

In the message, Ainsley told you that he had not been entirely forthright with you about the underground temple and reasoning for excavating it. He explained to Teymir and John why he was not forthcoming, explaining how he recognized Teymir as a [[Scourger]]. He explained a group of [[Harpers]] had recently set out to learn more about this group in order to provide you with more information about them, at the cost of some of their lives. He explained the Scourgers were a highly secret group of assassins that reported directly to Divine [[High Protector Anamanue Silverhand]], queen of the [[Everwatchers]] and the kingdom. He mentioned the program was scrapped at one point, but they did not know why (John Smith and Teymir have not told anyone this information yet).

He then proceeded to explain that there had been an outbreak of a "malady" among a group of isolated and dormant frost giant tribes in the far north, an area north of [[The Crags]], out of the reach of the Everwatch Kingdom. He mentioned the historic hostility between giant and small folk and that the tribe, led by [[Jarl Storvald]], is holding the people of [[Ironhaven]] responsible and amassing an army of barbarians and other powerful creatures against it. He told you that "[[Kwalish Tanthul]]" may have some research and knowledge into this malady and that a century or so ago he lead an expedition into the [[Nether Mountains]] in search of a "strange extra-planar vessel." He gave you an invention of his to transport you there quickly, informing you that you would have 2 dawns from the time you arrive to come back to the entrance point.

As [[Teymir]] and John began to leave, they mentioned to Mary about Ell's malady. Reminding Mary some of the malady mentioned in Ainsley's message, Mary said she might be able to help Ell and that the party would need to bring her under cover of night to [[Evelyn's General Store]].

As we pick up, it is around 1:00pm, you have all convened once again in your room in Stone Stallion, your appointment with the Everwatch Knights coming up in an hour. What do you do?

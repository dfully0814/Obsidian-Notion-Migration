# Last we left off...
Once on the surface you saw large triple-barreled anti-aircraft guns firing explosive red beams at hordes of aberrant creatures and blue [[Draconic]] creatures who had been raised by the other aberrant ones.

With [[Teymir]] still not in his right mind, [[Yang Tieh]] flew over while [[Elleanna Corvus]] held Teymir down and successfully removed his energy cell. At the moment Yang removed Teymir's energy cell, [[Robinson Fellweather]] flew over and attempted to stop Ell from holding Teymir down to allow him to go back down into the tunnel and find what he wanted. This resulted in a brief confrontation between Ell and Robinson as Ell attempted to shock Robinson's body, which he successfully counterspelled.

As Yang flew with Teymir, Teymir successfully freed himself from the armor as his exposed body rolled out into the white-hot cold of the Nether Mountains, debilitating his body almost instantly. Quickly following behind, [[John Smith]] flew up and grabbed Teymir and continued forward as Teymir was soon awoken from his stupor by a painful wave of cold.

Yang successfully pressed Teymir back into his armor and you began and very narrow escape from the island as the large guns fired overhead, you maneuvered through the aberrant hordes as well as attempting to maintain your trajectory and footing as the island underwent sudden periods of dropping altitude as the engines holding it aloft began to fail.

Teymir displayed the signs of debilitation to his body as he attempted to fire multiple eldritch blasts to clear some of the hordes only to hit several of you; however, John and Yang kept pace with one another up ahead and were able to gain enough ground to clear the way for the rest of you to make a successful escape as you watched the large mile-long island plummet to the ground followed by a blinding light and heat that singed the armor you were wearing as both the engines and [[Mythallar]] exploded nearly at the same time.

You then met [[Krol]] who had been waiting on you on the ledge of the mountains and made your way back to [[Baraskur]]. When you were about 90 minutes from Baraskur, you decided to take a short rest and conversed with Krol about [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]]. He expressed seemingly unwavering loyalty to Blazbaard as you began questioning Blazbaard's motives. Yang began intensely criticizing Krol and the [[Red Flayers ]]for having such a blind loyalty to Blazbaard and you begin to share that Blazbaard was looking to find what he wanted and would leave the people at a drop of a hat after that. Krol seemed incensed but also respectfully impressed by Yang's show of verbal force. After a very important attempt at persuasion which he succeeded, Krol was willing to hear more. At this point, Yang presented a vial of the black liquid that he found and explained what you had seen it do. Krol responded with surprise and demanded that you pour a drop of the liquid on his hand for verification.

He then told you that Blazbaard had told him that this liquid might exist on the island and that if any of you brought any back, he was to kill you and take it back to Blazbaard along with the energy cells. He then shared that some mysterious masked figures came into Baraskur sometime recently offering services to

Blazbaard in the fight against the [[Blood of Moureme]] in exchange for [[Klovag]]'s services to synthesize a substance they said would be mutual beneficial to themselves and Blazbaard in his war with the Morueme. He told you that he witnessed many experiments on various Red Flayers and has seen first hand what the substances can do. He also told you that Klovag referred to the substances as GP120, what he believed to be an arbitrary scientific classification given to the substance.

As Krol considered all these things, he became increasingly worried for his people and told you that you could not go back to Baraskur with this substance in your possession. He offered to draw you a map to your destination in the mountains as you described where you had come from. He then told you that he would have to make it look as though he subdued you and took some of the black substance. Yang gave Ell a vial of clear flying potion, which she turned black and handed Krol, telling him that this should at least buy him some time. He told you that he would do his best to verify what you've said and get more answers. Seeing that specifically, Yang did not trust him, he took out a small red stone very similar to a much large red stone Teymir picked up from the giant creature you encountered in the woods. He then cut his wrist and rubbed the stone in his blood as it began to glow inside. He then told you that with the stone, you would know his location at any time and that no other person's location could be substituted because the stone was connected to his blood.

You completed your rest as Krol stands with you and you are ready to part ways. You have also chosen to press on up to this point faster as not to lose an hour of travel time, so you all now have a point of exhaustion.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

# Last we left off...

The frost giant ambush began to subside as your party gathered together once again to assess the damage and possibly what lead to the ambush to begin with. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] began by searching for anyone still alive. He walked around seeing the large number of bodies and blood sprayed across the snowy ground--soldiers, giants, and noble figures mixed together. He came across a male noble figure, barely alive, dressed in a fine dark blue robe with gold trim and long black hair tied in a long braid. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] helped the man back into one of the train cars and magically relieved some of the man's wounds. With gratitude, the man introduced himself as [[Ethes Grahlund]], a member of [[House Grahlund]] out of [[Waterdeep]].

You all then debriefed some with one another as you met back together, realizing that now you were joined by the few remaining survivors from the ambush, two [[Everwatch Knights]], one of whom introduced herself as [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] and a commander who introduced himself as [[Commander Marcus Blackwood]]. You were also joined by the mysterious robed figure you had met on the train who introduced himself as [[Murlough Grahlund]], as well as the robotic-looking figure you have not spoken with much yet who had just returned from luring away the remaining frost giants from your location. You also met a wild-looking, unkempt man named [[Thryn]] who volunteered to lead your group forward as he mentioned knowing the mountainous regions of the north well. 

You then gathered yourselves and pressed forward with [[Thryn]] in the lead as you began to cross a large frozen lake that lead into the mountains beyond. As you slowly crossed the frail icy shelf of the lake, you heard a thunderous screech in the distance as a large solid-white creature rapidly barreled down upon your party and wrenched [[Teymir]] away in its talons high into the air. Soaring through the blinding snow, [[Teymir]] managed to maneuver out of the creature's talons, falling 30ft to the ground, and managing to land on his feet.

You eventually found your way into a cave to rest for the evening where [[Thryn]] warned you that many of you were not well-equipped for the cold, which would likely be an obstacle for you moving forward, reminding you to be aware of when you needed to rest as you didn't want to be caught unaware but another creature while already half-succumbed to the cold.

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] then began speaking more to [[Ethes Grahlund]] when [[Ethes Grahlund]] confessed to him that he had paid for some aspects of this train ambush to take place in order to assassinate a member of [[House Cassalanter]], whose name he didn't divulge and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] didn't ask. He said he knew this person would be on the train, but he was told it would be made to look like an accident and he thinks he may have been used as a patsy for a larger scheme, possibly to rescue the [[Thayan]] prisoner aboard the train. He mentioned that this prisoner's name is [[Sadia Amos]], who was apparently a person of interest for brokering an alliance between the [[Thayans]] and the frost giants, by what means he didn't know. When [[Asad Al-Nuri]] asked what was preventing him from reporting him to the [[Everwatch Knights]] just over next to the fire, [[Ethes Grahlund]] told him that the nice thing about the knights is that when a mission like this goes sideways this badly, they know there's no going back to [[Waterdeep]] to tell anyone anything. Taken aback by his coldness, [[Asad Al-Nuri]] stepped away to rejoin the rest of the party at the fire.

And that's where we pick up....

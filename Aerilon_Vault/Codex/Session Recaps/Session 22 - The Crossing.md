#recap 
# Last we left off...
The party concluded its harrowing encounter with the mysterious swarm of glowing beetles you came across, the swarm having knocked both [[Azure Flint]] and [[Tanavast Adamantus]] unconscious at various points before it was subdued. After a much-needed period of brief rest and trapping the beetles back in the main room where you found them, Azure and [[Teymir]] took shelter behind the northern double bronze doors as [[Yang Tieh]] and [[John Smith]] made short work of the other 20 or so beetles you had trapped in the room. The party investigated the remainder of this room.

Looking over the pile of bodies in the middle of the room, Yang noticed that all the bodies were human and male, and they were dressed in various decorative robes displaying abstract designs often threaded in gold and all were barefooted. Over the exposed skin of the bodies, particularly the faces, Yang noticed a series of lacerations and puncture wounds with blood trickling out from the wounds like they were still fresh. When Tanavast succumbed to the repeated attacks of the swarm in the corridor, Yang observed almost identical lacerations and puncture wounds on him. Teymir found a group of discarded staves and wands in one corner of the wound that looked like they had been partially eaten and seemed to all be devoid of any magical properties.

While resting and recovering from the initial attack of the swarm, Teymir spent some time with the mysterious ring he found. As he began to investigate the ring and meditate on its significance, treasured memories of his began to bubble to the surface of his mind, particularly the sense of inclusion he felt when he was brought into the [[Valkurians]] by [[Sighi Thorgison]]. As he experienced the happiness and longing for more of this, he watched as his hands and forearms became stone and then gradually receded. Reaching out to draw emotion from these memories several more times, Teymir learned that the longer he could focus on a specific memory and recall as much detail from that one memory as possible, the more effective the ring seemed to deliver. Focusing his emotion on a single memory and recalling as much detail as possible, he projected his emotion in Azure's direction as he slept, causing Azure's left leg to briefly turn to stone as it gradually receded.

Teymir realized there exists some kind of connection between his emotions evoked by memories and his magical abilities. Moving forward through the temple, the party found what looked like a trap that had been sprung while traversing up a 120ft staircase. You saw a large spherical hole in the wall that looked like a large had burst forth out of the wall. You also saw large broken pieces of stone lying all along the staircase.

You entered what appeared to be a ceremonial or processional hall of some kind, finding two apes lying dead on the floor along with a large silver sun painting on the floor with a large eye at its center. As Yang investigated the ape bodies, he noticed the bodies were covered in the same colored hair as the bodies [[Azure Flint]] and [[John Smith]] saw lying on the two large stone tables previously. He also noticed both apes were in a suspended state of decomposition with a similar fungus threaded through their bodies as Azure and John saw in the hallway where the humanoid figures stood in niches in the wall. The bodies showed no signs of physical trauma indicating the cause of death.

The party then entered a large room decorated in a cat motif where [[Teymir]] investigated a tiger that seemed to be frozen in place in the middle of the room in a prowling position and a stone statue of what appeared to be a man with the head of a tiger dressed in tribal hunting garb and carrying a spear with an obsidian tip. John investigated a large calendar stone hanging on one wall of the room and discovered it to be a lever that opened the entire wall into another room. Similarly, on the opposite side of the room, Yang investigated a large tiger engraving on the wall that seemed to have a hole in each eye large enough to reach a hand through. He pushed his staff through one of the eye holes, feeling a stone begin to slide the more he pushed.

He watched as this large engraving rotated counterclockwise on the wall and then opened a large circular section of the wall. As [[Yang Tieh]] stepped through this opening he saw a large circular room about 35ft in diameter with a 120ft metal walkway leading to another door on the opposite side of the room. 20ft below the walkway he saw what looked like a mass grave of hundreds of bodies stacked one upon the other. This mass of bodies had large flowers growing from it and the large petals of the flowers seemed to be subtly moving. He also saw 10 or so ashen humanoid figures crawling along with the 25ft ceiling above and going in and out of an opening in the ceiling. The aesthetic and environment of the temple that the party has experienced so far have drastically changed.

The temperature dropped to at least 10 to 15 degrees below zero, the walls of this room were not the pale brown stucco you've seen but instead were black stone walls with the same putrid fungus growing up the entirety of the walls. Yang immediately felt a complete sense of dread and gloom come over him and realized all the emotions you have experienced to this point have only been a precursor to this. The first primal emotion he felt was to throw himself off the side of the walkway, but he resisted.

The party began trying to communicate with the humanoid figures on the ceiling as they listened to the haunting sounds of hissing and seeing 4-6 ft long tongues from some of the figures began to protrude from the mouths. One of the figures came down onto the walkway and [[Teymir]] sent it a message asking for permission to pass. In response to receiving the message spell, the figure seemed to grow slightly larger in its frame and became almost ravenous in a short period of time as its tongue hung to the ground, bringing with it a similar dark orange liquid you saw from the beetles and Yang carries in one of his vials. The figure called to the others on the ceiling and the entire group began speedily climbing down the wall toward the walkway with loud ravenous hissing. And that's where we pick up.

# Last we left off...
Your battle with [[Insk]]'s brothers continued in the [[Arena of Baraksur]]. [[Robinson Fellweather]], not yet able to fully break his tether with [[Ugrug]] succumbed to wounds he received at Ugrug's hand and wounds Ugrug received through being dragged along the rock and ice surface behind Robinson's boar as he ran through a nearby portal to escape [[Arharzel]]'s looming presence above. [[Teymir]] was able to restore Robinson from the throes of death. Once restored, Robinson raced to the glyph pedestal nearby atop his boar, Ugrug in tow desperately attempting to stay upright and not be drug along the sharp stone ground. Before Ugrug could right himself, Robinson launched into the air and that was subsquently launched from one pedestal to the other as he attempted to communicate with Aharzel who was perched 60ft high against the ice ceiling. He began to communicate that your party and he may have a common enemy.

Meanwhile, [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Sigvag]] began fighting tooth and claw over the red obelisk. After blocking and doging several of Yang's quick attacks, Sigvag successfully connected with the red obelisk and fired a massive concussive blast that hit Arharzel, sending a shockwave through the arena mingled with Arhazel's furious roar. Arhazel then dismounted from the ice ceiling, swooped down and glided over to the red obelisk where he sank his teeth into Sigvag, mortally wounding him and sending him to his knees. Arhazel then looked at Yang and back at Sigvag and then perched himself on the ceiling once again, giving Yang the opening he needed to deal the final killing blow to Sigvag.

[[Elleanna Corvus]] was the first of your party to successfully connect with one of the obelisks. She managed to make her way to the green obelisk, hearing a chilling cacophony of indiscernible voices mingled together as she layed her hand on the obelisk. She then saw a vision of a black space filled with skeletal hooded flying creatures with no eyes and necrotic energy glowing from their eye sockets and mouths. Through her connection with the obelisk, she intuitively knew that she would be able to command these creatures, prompting her to release them as they began hurling orbs of necrotic energy of one of the large flame creatures that had recently risen from the lava bed.

After ducking several blows from [[Grozren]], Teymir managed to knock him from the upper tier of the arena with a few well-placed eldritch blasts, knocking him into the lava bed below. He then raced over to the set of crudely built mechanical armor sitting next to where Arharzel was initially chained and entered the suit. He then heard the same haunting indiscernible voices all around him, sensing sentience on all sides as something attempted to take over his mind. Teymir as unsuccessful in resisting, and the armor took control of him, firing a volley of what appeared to be small missiles from a cannon attached to its hand directly at Arharzel.

Seeing that the suit of armor might soon undo any diplomacy he was beginning to build with Arharzel, Robinson lobbed a scalding ball of fire which enveloped the armor and Teymir along with it, knocking Teymir unconscious. After a few moments, Teymir found himself somehow barely conscious again with a piercing headache and blurry vision as Arharzel looks on from afar perched along the icy ceiling and staring down with his cerulean eyes at the source of the devastating blow he just received with Yang now kneeling in front of him.

And that's where we pick up...

# Last we left off...
As a group, you resumed your attempt to save [[John Smith]] from the clutches of the final sea serpent creature. Shooting multiple eldritch blasts from the floor of the pool, [[Teymir]] was able to lift the creature 20ft. into the air, pulling John Smith out of the water, hurling Teymir back toward the silt beach, as [[Tanavast Adamantus]] plunged back into the pool below. As John Smith was helplessly flung around in the grip of the creature, who was able to maintain its death grip on him, [[Yang Tieh]] made a flying leap toward the creature, staff in hand, inflicting a stuff strike on it and sending green necrotic energy all throughout its body. The stunned creature was no longer able to maintain its grip on John Smith and dropped him back into the water.

Tanavast and [[Azure Flint]] successfully pushed and pull him out of the water, very narrowly saving him from succumbing to the amount of water in his lungs. Grabbing the rope to which his metal flail was tied, Tanavast killed the creature in a whirl of radiant fury by swinging the rope around and into the body of the creature sending an explosion of radiant energy and metal into its body, cutting it in half. Azure began pursuing the fire creature which had come from his book as it barreled through the narrow hallways of the temple, leaving fire and destruction in its wake.

While binding their wounds, the rest of the party heard what sounded like the screeching of bats coming from somewhere close to the room. After the sound gradually died down, [[Azure Flint]] eventually came back into the room, and the fire creature was nowhere to be seen. Azure did not tell anyone what had happened as everyone rested from their wounds. While resting, [[Teymir]] saw 12 or so glowing eyes in the hallway as he quickly ran over to close the double doors to protect the party in the beached room. While resting, you heard what sounded like clicking sounds start to permeate through the walls all around you. During your rest period, [[Tanavast Adamantus]] was again assaulted by an unseen malady, causing violent nausea and seeming to drain a good portion of his strength.

This assault on him seems to have been worse than the first you encountered. Continuing beyond the room, you came to a room where you saw neatly stacked stones and rubble, and Azure saw his stone dagger begin to glow as well as Yang's stone great sword. You passed through a door outlined by a pyramid and sun as Azure cast a shatter spell on some of the stone piles in the hallway, causing an area of the level above you to cave in, blocking the door way you had just passed through. Making your way forward, [[Tanavast Adamantus]] went down a diverging hallway to find an ancient lock mechanism, which he successfully broke and released, revealing a corridor containing a skeletal figure holding a ornate silver coffer.

He called the rest of the party to come to view it with him. As he looked over the coffer, Azure recognized a seal on the coffer to be that of the [[Telamont Tanthul]]'s Enclave, known as [[Thultanthar]], a [[Netherese]] floating city presided over by the Archmage Telamont Tanthul during the time the magic kingdom of [[Netheril Empire]] was in power in [[Aerilon]]. [[Azure Flint]] also noticed the coffer seemed to be suspended in time, finding it strange that the coffer seemed to show no signs of wear or aging. Remembering the stories he's heard during his travels of the power of the Netherese mages, he knew this wasn't an object to be plundered without forethought or further investigation. We pick up as the party is standing over the skeletal body of an unknown figure clutching this decorative silver coffer as Azure has just realized this information about it.

#recap
"Aerilon", from the Elven word for "Airon", meaning to "empty out", "to clear", "to begin anew". It is a land reborn from the ashes of a war among entities beyond imagining--the great [[Calamity]], where children of a mysterious collective entity know as the [[Sirin]]--children who were [[Primordials]] born of entropy and the swirling and wild forces of creation found a common and unnatural desire among them to supplant their more ordered siblings, now known as the [[Prime Deities]]. 

As mythologies and legends of the [[Calamity]] have evolved and spread across [[Toril]], one name has arisen as a haunting byword now spoken only in the whispers of conspiracy theorists, anarchists, drunks, street urchins, and any other societal undesirable not well educated--the name [[Tharizdun]], from ancient Elven meaning "Endless Nothing".

The source of the name is shrouded in mystery and speculation as the name seems to have appeared in later versions of writings regarding the [[Calamity]]--many of which were suppressed and destroyed by [[The Exarcs]] of [[Netheril]] during an event known as [[The Appropriation]] where the Exarcs deemed all religious or superstitious material to be confiscated and destroyed across all [[Netherese Enclaves]]. This is why today it is difficult to determine fact from fiction in regard to any events around the [[Calamity]] and the [[Age of Arcanum]] previous to it.

The name [[Tharizdun]] is most often connected with the rise of the [[Primordials]] against the [[Prime Deities]] but in what way has only become more enshrouded in mystery as time goes on. It is said that beings known as the [[Sirin]] interceded in the war among their children when [[Tharizdun]] had become so powerful as to consume everything that was. Seeking to remove its memory, the [[Sirin]] sought to give new birth to the world, which failed and is now referred to as the [[First Consummation]]. Instead of giving new life to the world with no influence of [[Tharizdun]] in its memory, reality was sundered, leaving broken shards of what formerly was and [[Tharizdun]]'s memory in one of those shards.

[[Teymir]], you and your sponsor and mentor in the [[Valkurians]], Captain [[Azure Flint]], were sent by [[Sighi Thorgison]], [[Harbormaster]] of the Valkurian cell in [[Waterdeep]], to [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]] just outside of the fortress city of [[Thornhold]] to acquire what he referred to as a valuable "asset" which had been stolen from a Valkurian smuggling vessel named the [[Jade Lion]]. 

You embarked on this mission where you met [[Yang Tieh]], who you learned was also a member of the [[Valkurians]] in the cell operating out of [[Thornhold]]. You found a group of [[Drow]] at the lighthouse, who seemingly were the ones that attacked and stole from the [[Jade Lion]], and you learned the "asset" was in fact not an object but a person--a young [[Elven]] girl named [[Leowin Moonflower]]. You learned these Drow had a potent interest in apprehending her, and you managed to rescue her from the caverns under the lighthouse after fighting with many of the Drow and a mysterious powerful female Drow figure who set of a basketball-sized black orb, which caused a large tidal wave to manifest from the sea and spill over into [[Thornhold]].

After getting to know her better, you learned that [[Leowin Moonflower]] seemed to have another entity connected to her that would often seem to have some level of influence over her as you saw her manipulating the waves, wind, and water and even passing on some of her abilities to [[Yang Tieh]] to help them escape the Drow.

Throughout your journey with her, [[Leowin Moonflower]] shared with you that she was taken from her home of [[Evermeet]], which she referred to as the last remaining true Elven civilization in [[Toril]], by a group of mages she called [[Shadovar]], who you later learned were lead by [[Kwalish Tanthul]]. She was taken to a strange land called [[Laerkond]] where they performed some sort of rite or ritual upon her and she woke up connected to this entity.

As you traveled back to [[Waterdeep]], deciding if you were going to hand [[Leowin Moonflower]] over to the [[Valkurians]], you came across a vessel traveling in the opposite direction named the [[Anguila]], piloted by a former [[Everwatch Knights]] soldier named [[Tanavast Adamantus]], who seemed to quickly become enamored with [[Leowin Moonflower]] who he later told you looked much like his daughter and you also learned from Leowin seemed to possess a power she was hauntingly familiar with and hadn't felt in a long time, which she remembered previously coming from the [[Shadovar]]. After discussing with [[Teymir]] the dangers of magical practice and use, he joined your party and traveled with you.

You then met a strange and alien figure, looking like a hippopotamus in the face, with a monocle, high-top black boots, white trousers, and navy overcoat who introduced himself as [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]. He employed you to travel into an underground [[Nexalese]] temple dedicated to the [[Nexalese]] god of death, [[Kisin]] in order to recover what he referred to as [[Spell Lenses of Bifurcation]], a powerful magical artifact he wished to recover for the [[Harpers]], who he said he was an influential member of. He also recognized a tattooed symbol on Teymir's hand to be that of the [[Scourgers]].

As you traversed the temple, you found all strange manner of creatures and an oppressive force of some kind that regularly assaulted your minds and your senses. You discovered through a number of auditory gems by a Netherese mage named [[Polaris Detarish]] that a [[Netherese]] research group had gone to the temple and clashed with the tribal people at one point. She alluded to a "new material" she and some other mages were researching, referring to it as GP120, and mentioned this area seemed to enhance it in interesting ways. It appeared the group had been sent by and individual named [[Telamont Tanthul]] to research possible weaponization of this material to aid in an ongoing war the [[Netherese]] were having against another party Detarish referred to as the [[Phaerimm]]. 

While traversing the temple, [[Leowin Moonflower]] was possessed by a series of shadow creatures that you came across and chose to kill herself before they could fully overtake her by nicking her throat with a poisoned ring that [[Azure Flint]] had previously given her.

As you continued traversing the temple, you entered a dark and cold circular area where strange creatures crawled the walls and the ceilings before a large plant-like creature made of what appeared to be bodies, crawled up and over the platform you were on. After being told by [[Tanavast Adamantus]] to run, you all escaped successfully from the room, leaving him behind to be consumed by the creature.

Later, [[Yang Tieh]] befriended an undead chief of the [[Nexalese]] people and acquired a tiger companion named [[Kaya]] who joined your party soon before you eventually exited the temple through a decorative mansion you found after ascending some steps up from the underground temple. In this mansion you found a decorative "C" which [[Azure Flint]] recognized as the seal of [[House Cassalanter]]. You also found a scene of death at a long dinner table and you found a note read, "We have your daughter in [[Gloomwrought]], give us GP120 or she dies."

You met back with [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] to give him the lenses that you found, some of which he allowed you to keep to reward you for your efforts. You also acquired a large tome from the temple named [[The Palpable Cohesion of Formless Corporeality]] written by [[Telamont Tanthul]], which [[Teymir]], and which revealed [[Telamont Tanthul]] studied and theorized about what he referred to as "transitory realities" that acted as "doorways" or gates between conjoining realities, which formidable practitioners of the arcane could access or leverage.

Later, while you were camping in the [[Kryptgarden Forest]] in the [[Dessarin Valley]] on your way back to [[Waterdeep]], you met a half-elf woman named [[Elleanna Corvus]]. She gave [[Teymir]] a wooden music box that triggered a strong lost memory of his where he was in young child in a carpentry shop next to an abnormally large man. The large man's voice mentioned the name [[Rushnaa]] as a pet bird Teymir had which seemingly had died and the large man referred to Teymir as "little fire". Ell later told Teymir the box was given to her by a mentor of her's named [[Galladon]] in order to give her credibility to join the party because some of what the party had stumbled into, her mentor also had a vested interest in.

During [[Yang Tieh]]'s watch that evening, he walked away to follow a druid-like halfling named [[Pippal]] to his home inside of a large tree in the middle of the forest, when the rest of the party were suddenly attacked by a large sentient tree creature which seemed to be infected and possibly animated by some sort of malady. Once you managed to slay the creature, a fight erupted between [[Azure Flint]], [[Teymir]], and [[Yang Tieh]] over Yang leaving the party unguarded during his watch. Azure suddenly turned on Teymir and beat Teymir unconscious in a bloody pulp before soon leaving the party entirely.

While camping outside the city of [[Kheldell]] in the aftermath of those events, the party witnessed a large mechanical bird-like creature fly over and begin dropping electrical bombs on something in the distance above the [[Westwood Forest]]. You went to the forest later to investigate and found several logging camps decimated, and a orphaned girl named [[Jovi]] and a giant humanoid creature with grayed skin and black ichor running from its eyes. Teymir acquired a large stone attached to a chain from the creature with what appeared to be blood swirling inside the stone. Choosing to stab the creatures eye, Ell was then covered by the black ichor which left boiled and rotting flesh on her body, which she had to conceal for some time with a cloak before being healed by [[Mary Emsworth]] who you encountered in the city of [[Amphail]]. 

While camping in the [[Westwood Forest]], [[Teymir]] found out that the [[Everwatchers]] had placed a bounty on his head when he was suddenly attacked by a half-orc mercenary named [[Ziraj]]. At the time, he assumed it was because he had been discovered as a magic practitioner.

You then traveled to the city of [[Amphail]], which you found to be under heavy security because of the recent attack on [[Kheldell]] by the giant creature. You presented yourselves as refugees from [[Kheldell]] and managed to successfully enter the city after leaving all of your magical items behind.

You spent several days in the city where you learned about a violent and ancient feud among [[House Cassalanter]] and [[House Grahlund]] when a firefight broke out in the city center between young members of both of these houses, leaving several dead in the street before the [[Everwatch Knights]] managed to subdue several individuals and quell the violence.

You also met a smooth talking wealthy man with handlebar mustache, top hat, fine suit, and monocle named [[Aiden Zatchet]], the proprietor of a local night club and hotel named the [[Stone Stallion]]. He asked your party to rescue a woman named [[Marge]], who he described as the love of his life who had been captured and sold into the slave trade by [[Captain Riffolk Salte]]. He also helped prepare you to later be questioned by [[Captain Roland Royston]] of the [[Everwatch Knights]] regarding your presence in the city and your description of the events surrounding the attack on [[Kheldell]].

You then made your way to [[Evelyn's General Store]] which you later discovered served as a business front for a site of operations for the [[Harpers]] operated by a dark-skinned female with long dark dreadlocked hair named [[Mary Emsworth]] and her robotic helper [[Tick-Clack]].

A tense stand-off occurred with [[Tick-Clack]], not knowing whether you were friend or foe and [[Elleanna Corvus]] received a mortally wounding blast from one of the construct's eyes. 

While unconscious, Ell had a vision of standing on a long pier just outside [[Neverwinter]] where her father [[Tanavast Adamantus]] once served in a garrison with the [[Everwatch Knights]]. She saw a distant city shrouded in darkness with thousands of green glowing lanterns rising to the sky from within it. She sensed she had been to this city before but it didn't look as it did now. She began talking with her mother who she saw walking toward her down the dock. Her mother asked her what she thought of the city, telling her "They say [[Neverwinter]] is one of the Jewels of the North. We should be proud of your father for being stationed here." Her mother told Ell that she saw her in her room the previous evening practicing magic. She began to plead with her and warn her of the consequences of what could happen to her or her father if she was discovered. She also warned her of her duty to report her to the [[Everwatchers]] if she saw her practicing again.

As though there were a subtle shift in the memory; this part not something that Ell remembered from before…her mother slightly changed the tone of her voice, and began to tell her a story of a city called [[Gloomwrought]] where the people once believed that their existence depended on living on in the memory of those whom they loved and those who loved them. So every year they would make decorative magical lanterns, thousands of them. They called it the [[Festival of Memories]]. They would light these lanterns, shut off all the lights to the city, and release them into the sky. They believed the magical properties of these lanterns could carry the memories of the deceased and the living across the land so they would never be forgotten. She told her that one day a terrible curse came to the city and they all stopped remembering and stopped making lanterns and the festival was forgotten. She began to warn Ell that there is a "bridge" between life and chaos built upon the memories of the living and the dead, and that there are forces who seek to destroy this bridge. She told her that she would learn more in time but she should help her friends and remain watchful and vigilant. She was then given a finely made porcelain white mask that she held in her hands as she awoke in the underground area below [[Evelyn's General Store]].

Mary lead you below the store where you found a high-tech control center where you watched several holographic recordings from [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] sharing that some answers to the current strange events you had witnessed lied far north on the [[Nether Mountains]]. Through a wormhole-like device Mary provided you, you were transported to the Nether Mountains where you met a Hobgoblin scholar and mage named [[Klovag]] after saving [[Yang Tieh]] from certain death as he was drug through the bowels of the icy caverns by a large centipede creature while the rest of you mounted it's back and attacked all the way down. 

Klovag lead you to the cavern city of [[Baraskur]] where you fought with several members of the Hobgoblin mercenary group named the [[Red Flayers]] and met their leader [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] who you learned was keeping [[Klovag]] prisoner by telling him his family would be harmed if he didnt aid Blazbaard.

You then met with a group of Hobgoblins in combat in a large arena in the city where you were victorious and met a large white dragon who seemingly was being kept imprisoned by the [[Red Flayers]] and was subdued by the chants of a group of humanoid figures wearing decorative dragon masks. 

Before meeting with [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]], while attempting to attune to her newly acquired mask, Ell had a vision of a shadowy figure with white hair who confronted her on her progress infiltrating the group. The figure warned her not to get attached and told her that attachments would make her weak. The figure also granted her the ability to extract memories from those whom she has killed in and store them away for later reference and access.

You met with [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] who told [[Teymir]] to kill [[Klovag]] for his failure to subdue your party in the ice caverns. Teymir chose instead to beat him unconscious. Blazbaard then ordered Klovag thrown over the balcony. [[Elleanna Corvus]] quickly jumped over with him trying to save him and failed to do so. Klovag hit the ground barely alive when [[Elleanna Corvus]] capitalized on the opportunity to extract Klovag's memories

[[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] then tasked you to travel to the [[Moon Pass]] where an ancient vessel had crashed in order to recover energy cells that you would split. You traveled there through the winding passes of the [[Nether Mountains]] with Blazbaard's lieutenant of sorts, a Hobgoblin with noble clothing named [[Krol]]. You all donned heavy mechanical armor and traveled to the Netherese floating vessel lodge in a large miles long chunk of the mountain floating out in the middle of the pass. Once there you saw remnants of what appeared to be the bodies of large group of blue-skinned hybrid humanoid/draconic creatures which seemed to have turned on and killed one another and a strange inscription scrawled into the wall in one of the living quarters that read, " [[The Beginning is Ending]] ". 

While exploring the island you found what turned out to be [[Kwalish's Journal]]. Along with many other revelations, you made the connectio that he and [[Klovag]] were somehow the same person who lived a millenia apart.

At the center, you found a large octopus-like creature consuming a large orange sphere that seemed to be powering what remained of the vessel.. This creature caused you to relive many of your most treasured memories, causing many of you to walk helplessley into danger as you fought the creature. The creature more vigorously began to consume the power source of the island and depleted it as the entire island began plummeting to the depths of the pass below and you all desperately escaped the island as you were attacked from the sky and the ground.

Your party then decided not to travel back to [[Blazbaard Glagaaz]] but instead go back to [[Amphail]] from where you had come. In your journey back, you encountered a number of other deadly creatures in the ice caverns and unfortunately had to leave [[Kaya]] behind or face certain death.

Once back in [[Amphail]] you discovered from another of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]]'s recordings that shadowy creatures had overrun [[Kheldell]] and a large group of [[Drow]] had captured [[Thornhold]] and were holding it. He offered [[Phandalin]] as a safe place to meet him and regroup.

What you did not know, is that while you were gone the [[Everwatch Knights]] had trapped [[Evelyn's General Store]] upstairs due to suspition of ongoing events in and around the store. When you topped the stairs, an alarm sounded. The store was quickly raided by the knights, and [[John Smith]] was surrounded and killed while the rest of you managed to escape.

You then worked with [[Alas Grahlund]] to find [[Aiden Zatchet]] and kill him and told you that he was formerly known as [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] and that he was involved in mysterious and nefarious schemes, particular around the shipping business [[House Cassalanter]] owns. You partnered once again with the crew of the [[Dawn Chaser]] with whom you found [[Captain Riffolk Salte]] aboard his ship the [[Fortunate Son]] near the [[Whalebone Islands]] where you contronted him in a fiery ship-to-ship battle in the middle of a raging thunderstorm. [[Captain Riffolk Salte]] was killed in this battle while [[Aiden Zatchet]] was eventually apprehended and interrogated by [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]].

He told them that he'd been and [[Everwatchers]] containct paid by them. He had been offered payment to maintain a cover-up by the Everwatchers regarding the location somewhere on teh sea where they've been shipping increasing numbers of [[Aerilon]] citizens. He told them the evidence was passed to him by a man named [[Gerard Vos]] out of the city of [[Yartar]]. He also told them he had fallen out of favor with [[House Cassalanter]] when his brother [[Aldous Cassalanter]] had suddenly disappeared at their family's mountain villa many years ago. He shared his father was [[Bertio Cassalanter]] and held him responsible for his brother's disappearance.

As the next month passed, [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Teymir]] separated from [[Yang Tieh]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]] during the battle with [[Captain Riffolk Salte]]. They traveled to a local [[Valkurians]] contact named [[Tamerland Quixat]] who helped them fake their deaths, knowing they were now hotly pursued by many different parties. They also each managed to steal a pair of horses and train them--who they named [[Noctis]] and [[Tahari]].

Over the same month, you heard reports that a sizable [[Thayan]] army had traveled across the [[Sea of Fallen stars]] to the [[Anauroch Desert]] where they had established a large garrison and has begun threatening in cold war fashion the borders of [[Aerilon]].

After a month passed, the party reunited in the city of [[Yartar]] during the local [[Hiring Faire]] for mercenaries and anyone skiled to dig up a high-paying and likely illegal job of just about any sort. Here, the party met [[Gerard Vos]] and his bodyguard [[Brandt]] who they learned is president of [[Vos Industries]], a large technology and weapons manufacturer and distributor. Vos joined your group after becoming interested in [[Yang Tieh]]'s spear.

For the first time, the party also met [[Galladon]], [[Elleanna Corvus]]'s mentor, when he seemed to slow and move time backward around you while sitting in a local pub called [[The Winter Winds]]. [[Elleanna Corvus]] then had a vision of a very familiar church in her hometown of [[Phandalin]] inside a Church of [[Bahamut]], seated next to her mother in a pew. She watched as several priests of Bahamut, clad in blue and silver robes, walked down the middle aisle of the church carrying various censers of smoking incense. When they arrived at the front, the back door swung open and voices started haphazardly shouting, "Get down!," as various robed individuals wearing the same white cowls overlaying darker finer clothing and black obscured faces as Ell saw in the pub, began targeting specific noble individuals in the cathedral, grabbing them around the face and sending waves of radiant light out of their eyeballs, instantly killing them where they sat.

One of the robed figures began to rush to the front of the church where he saw Ell standing, having decided to not follow her mother out of the church this time but instead stand in the middle aisle and face the attackers. The robed individual rushed up to Ell, looked behind and killed one of the priests who was suddenly revealed to have transformed into a red-robed individual with a bald ceremonially tattooed head resembling that of the Thayans. The figure pulled back the hood of his robe, revealing himself to be Teymir and shouting at Ell to get out of the church as he proceeded to turn and face now empty pews. Ell watched him begin to wave his hands as the whole church seemed to begin to shimmer, a large dark sphere began to grow at the center and bend and discolor all the beams of light coming through the stained glass. At this point the scene folded in on itself and Ell found herself back in the pub sitting with Galladon and Teymir.

Shocked and awestruck, Ell attempted to contain herself and asked Galladon what his directive was. He told her that he was interested in destroying the [[House Xorlarrin]] dark elves who have begun to surface for unknown reasons to the south in [[Thornhold]] and retrieve a dodecahedron device from them. He didn't give reason for wanting to do so beyond it helping with the current situation around the [[Dessarin Valley]].

You all then set out for the city of [[Thornhold]], deciding to first stop in [[Phandalin]] to meet with [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] and gather supplies. On the way, you came across a large clearing in the [[Dessarin Valley]] where you saw hundreds of dead [[Everwatch Knights]] lying everywhere. While investigating the bodies, [[Elleanna Corvus]] had a sudden and vivid memory of her father playing hide and seek with her and finding her under the bed in her room. In that moment, an shadowy and armor-clad figure with large sword and shield and on horseback appeared in the middle of the clearing and attacked the party. [[Elleanna Corvus]] later discovered that this was her father [[Tanavast Adamantus]] when she managed to somehow get through to him for a brief moment and heard his voice tell her to run because a "crossing" had opened.

You then arrived at the city of [[Phandalin]] where the traveling circus known as the [[Day of Wonders]], overseen by charismatic figure [[Zardoz Zord]] had arrived in [[Phandalin]]. You witnessed a spectacular and magical parade put on by the circus. You stayed the evening at the [[Sleeping Giant Inn]] where [[Elleanna Corvus]] shared with [[Teymir]] her possible desire to break away from [[Galladon]]'s influence while they drank high-priced alcohol on the roof of the inn.

To cap off a wistful and pleasant evening [[Gerard Vos]] decided to travel over to an eccentric-looking tent with a sign that read [[Ms. Florina's Fantasmagoria]] where he met a stringy-haired female with long gaunt fingers who said she would reward him with a powerful artifact if he would draw from a nearby deck of black cards instead of drawing from a decorative bag that it seemed most patrons were pulling from as they entered her tent. Vos decided to pull a card with black flames on it.

As Vos exited the tent, he saw the distorted and shimmering form of a multi-armed creature, large and hulking carrying an oversized flaming axe in one of its hands. As he looked over to Vos, he heard a voice in his head that said, "Good evening Mr. Vos. I believed we'll have plenty of time to get better acquainted" as it began to cackle. It then said, "Now you will see the kind of suffering that you will bring..." as it began to moan louder and louder. This lead to an blood thirsty frenzy sweeping over the entire city of [[Phandalin]] as normal citizens and [[Everwatch Knights]] began attacking one another and [[Yang Tieh]], the bloody butcher, stood in the center of the city and dropped one frenzied citizen after another of all shapes, sizes, and ages while [[Gerard Vos]] himself succumbed to the frenzy several times.

You eventually managed to damage the creature enough that it fled after telling Vos that it was now going to visit his friends.

The party managed to escape [[Phandalin]], accompanied by [[Captain William Acox]] of the [[Everwatch Knights]] with whom you stayed the night in a cave you found near [[Phandalin]] to sort out what had just happened, accompanied also by [[Azure Flint]]'s friend [[Halia Thornton]] who was also a resident of [[Phandalin]]. During your evening in the cave, [[Captain William Acox]] became aware of Teymir's magical abilities and a tense stand-off occurred which resulted in Teymir shooting the captain in the head at point-blank range, which then lead to another tense stand-off between Teymir and Ell.

While sleeping in the cave, Ell had a vision of a dark and gray beach with ash falling from the sky and dulled and almost absent emotion all around her. Behind her she saw a sprawling mountain range and a huge black citadel in the distance nestled in the mountains with tall black and narrow spires. She saw a large golden tree shining like the sun, the only thing of color, that seemed to shine down onto a city at the base of the citadel's mountain. 

[[Galladon]] appeared to her there and lead her down into the ocean water until a portal of sorts opened deep in the water which they both passed through. In a decorative room upheld by large pillars and pale green light, [[Elleanna Corvus]] met a slender black figure with a porcelain mask who seemed to coalesce out of a swarm of black butterflies. She referred to herself as the [[The Guide]]. She told Ell she had come to this world a lost, broken, and fragmented individual--remembering nothing about herself or how she came to be here. Over countless ages, she has managed to piece together elements of who she was, who she is, and what her purpose is; however, she seems to not have uncovered it all. She did not divulge to Ell how she pieced this information together.

She once was a regent of the ancient [[Elven]] Kingdom of [[Illefarn]] during the [[Age of Arcanum]] before the [[Calamity]]. During the Calamity, an ancient force some of her people referred to as the '"[[Endless Nothing]]", was stirred and began corrupting, twisting, and empowering many of the [[Primordials]], who eventually became the those known as the [[Betrayer Gods]]. One of these corrupted individuals, named [[Lolth]], established a stronghold in the bowels of the earth where Illefarn was located. She began enticing and corrupting the elves of Illefarn with promises of untapped power and knowledge, drawing the weak, power hungry, and ambitious into her grasp. These devotees to Lolth called themselves the [[Children of Malice]].

The [[The Guide]] evacuated her people when she saw a war was brewing in the [[Illefarn]] kingdom and she and her people fled to an island they found far into the [[Trackless Sea]] which her people later named "[[Evermeet]]".

On the island of Evermeet, The Guide first encountered what she referred to as a beacon ([[Sirin Beacons]]. A great light appeared to her at the location of this beacon, asked her what its name was, and she named it "[[Sirin]]", which roughly translated means "[[purposeful light]]".

Recovering all the [[Sirin Beacons]] is key to restoring the Sirin and helping it understand its purpose, as well as being key to freeing [[Tanavast Adamantus]] from [[Tharizdun]]'s hands.

Once out of Ell's vision, you continued toward [[Thornhold]], soon entering a raging storm near the [[Sea of Swords]] and you were attacked by shadowy creatures as you approached the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. A Drow man with white spiked hair came to your aid, who you later learned was a defected [[Thayan]] soldier named [[Cassius Cromwell]] and his wife Raene and infant son Caleb. He told you the [[Thayans]] had sent a highly technical hunting construct after him called a [[Retriever]] to kill or apprehend him. You learned that he serves [[Auril]] and possessed air and lightning abilities similar to [[Yang Tieh]]. He told you that he and his family were refugees from [[Kheldell]] where they had sought refuge after he defected from a Thayan military unit. He told you that the [[Thayans]] have become ruthless in searching for mysterious holy artifacts.

You successfully faced and defeated this Retriever in the [[Mere of Dead Men]]. While in these series of caves, Ell ventured off to search for danger and came across [[Captain Alford Ainsley]], whom she chose to secretly assassinate for his memories and pass off his death as natural, which she managed to do for quite a while. You also met Ainsley's robotic docent in the caves named [[Lyra]] who lead you out to the ocean to Ainsley's crashed interplanetary vessel named the [[Paramount]] controlled by an advanced AI named who referred to itself as [[ROMA]]. Once aboard the ship you made several needed repairs to it and you found a pail yellow-skinned figure very alien in its appearance when you entered the [[Infirmary]]. It was lying unconscious and alone. When [[Teymir]] and [[Yang Tieh]] entered the room they felt a sudden strong gravitational pull as Teymir was pulled rapidly toward the body and was engulfed by a large void that opened around the body and disappeared. He opened his eyes to see darkness all around him, and distant and large floating shapes that at first appeared to be large solid masses by then appeared to also move in a sentient way.

As quickly as he disappeared, he reappeared in the room with a long beard and disheveled look as though around 5 years had passed for him in a moment. He quickly realized he possessed strange abilities he had never known such as hearing faint noises as though they were booming, a significantly heightened intelligence, and the ability to read the actions and mannerisms of others in an expert way.

You then exited the [[Paramount]] in a small submarine that you traveled in all the way to [[Thornhold]]. On the submarine, a heated confrontation began between [[Elleanna Corvus]] and the rest of the party over her assassination of [[Captain Alford Ainsley]] when Teymir, with his unique abilities, was able to discern that she was lying when questioned about it. 

Azure told Ell the only reasons he wasn't going to kill her is for her father who was a better person than she'll ever be and that he owed it to Tanavast. Teymir shared his view with Ell that even [[Galladon]] is more trustworthy than she is because he's predictable.  Ell told him that she would likely have to kill again to advanced Galladon’s goals and to become more powerful in order to save her father. Teymir warned her that she would never be powerful enough on her own to save her father. Instead, he conveyed to her that power lies in the group around her and who you can trust. He told her that the more she killed, the more power she was giving up. Teymir concluded by telling her “we’ll get him back” and Ell telling Teymir that she would try and be the person he thinks she can be and Teymir telling her she needs to decide who she’s going to be.

Teymir and Azure then spoke privately concerning [[Elleanna Corvus]]. [[Azure Flint]] told Teymir not to let this betrayal of Ell’s make him bitter. He told Teymir the world is screwed up enough without people like Teymir wanting to see their friends dead.  Azure mentioned that for the time being it appears that they need her and Teymir doesn’t need to be associated with or become the kind of person that would kill a young woman in her sleep. Azure told Teymir that he would need to learn when he’s being stupid and when he’s not. If he decides to be stupid with Ell, he’ll have to live with the consequences. He concluded by telling Teymir that he wouldn’t kill someone Teymir’s care about unless he knew that was something Teymir wanted. The decision is up to Teymir for better or worse.

As the situation began to settle, Teymir had a sudden vision as he saw a fly land on his hand. He awoke to see a large and decorative lecture room. He awoke to look out through strings of long black hair. He then heard a series of loud pops as a large row of windows at the top of the room shattered followed by 3 flying hite-haired figures with large flowing robes that extended outward like wings fly through the gaping holes and land at the top of the hall.

He then heard a earnest female voice from behind him that said, "Ildan, we must act now! This is our only chance! You look up to see an ornate geometric shape with 12 flat sides, a single handle on each end, and a pulsing orange glow at its center. The female figure gets over to you, leans over as you are pulling yourself up from the ground, coursing pain throughout your body. She places a hand around the back of your neck and pulls you in close, touching her head with your’s. “Ildan, I will tell Telta and Ithrel that you have been brave. Be among them, find how they can be stopped no matter how many lifetimes it takes. I will find you again and will always guide you. I love you, my son.”  These are the last words he hears before seeing the blurry image of a blade at this neck line whirling toward him and then...darkness.

You arrived at the area where [[Thornhold]] should be, seeing ash falling from the sky, a large portal thrumming above a large black citadel in the distance, a large camp, and a series of blue-robed mages channeling energy into a dark orange sphere as that energy was then redirected into the large portal atop the citadel.

You discovered the camp to be filled with [[Everwatch Knights]] and you met [[Captain Roland Royston]] there and explained your presence and your intentions to help discover what happened to [[Thornhold]]. After some tense conversations, he told you that if you mean to enter the citadel, you would need to be accompanied by one of their one, and he sent you to the tent of [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]. After talking with him, he told you that you would each need to give a sampling of your blood to the [[Everwatch Knights]] to ensure you could be found if you tried anything foolish. You all refused his initial request, which resulted in his stabbing Ell directly in the throat with a dagger, causing her to bleed out and fall unconscious. 

[[Captain Roland Royston]] eventually deescalated the situation and [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] was made to heal Ell. In the camp, you also met [[Bertio Cassalanter]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and learned there seemed to be a heavy tension between the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] and [[Everwatch Knights]]. You also met [[Lady Liane Antiet]] of the [[Arcane Brotherhood]] as well as Teymir's former mentor in the [[Scourgers]], [[Master Aegith Rane]]. Surprisingly, [[Lady Liane Antiet]] recognized [[Gerard Vos]] and referred to him with a different name--"Bren". You learned that apparently [[Gerard Vos]] had also previously been a Scourger in the past.

[[Master Aegith Rane]] was overjoyed to see Teymir. He began to speak much of Teymir's potential and power. He told Teymir that it was he who had wiped Teymir's memory in order to protect him. He told Teymir the [[Scourgers]] had been the arm [[High Protector Anamanue Silverhand]] had used to overthrow the previous emperor long ago and had later disbanded their use. All the Scourgers were then hunted down and killed except three, those whom Master Aegith had taken particular interest in saving--Teymir, Bren (Vos), and a third individual who Teymir only knows to be a female at this point. Master Aegith refused to tell Teymir anymore about his past and told him he was protecting him and that Teymir was on his own path now. He told Teymir that if he wanted to know more, he would have to discover it on his own. He also told Teymir that he believed his students must walk through fire on their own and come out the other side refined and stronger and he's proud to see Teymir has done so.

You then heard a commotion outside as it appeared an army of creatures were mounting an assault on the Everwatch Knights camp from the mountains. In the midst of the chaos, you found an entrance into the heart of the mountains underneath the citadel. In the darkness of the caverns, you encounter a group of what you later learned were [[House Xorlarrin]] warriors and mages and arachnid creatures with human faces.

You also met a large and abnormally slender figured named [[Abrak Vraelo]] who you learned was from a different Drow house and had been somehow saved from experimentation by [[Lyrala Xorlarrin]], the matron mother of [[House Xorlarrin]]. Finding out Teymir's interest in [[Dunamancy]] you learned that he had previously been a devotee of the [[Sirin]] through a verbal tradition from his family that was passed down to him. After giving Teymir a crown of sorts that allowed him to manifest a cape of beetles that he could control, you ventured forward through another area where you faced several Drow warriors and mages in the dark and you met up with [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]]. 

Knowing that the commotion of your combat has likely alerted more forces futher into the caverns you ran out of the area and came to a new area that appeared to be a makshift prison with a number of individuals behind warded heavy bars. One of those individuals reached out and grabbed Teymir by the arm. The indivdual looked somewhat similar to the other pale yellow-skinned creature you found aboard the [[Paramount]]. You watched as Teymir went down on one knee in the middle of this prison area.

And that's where we pick up....

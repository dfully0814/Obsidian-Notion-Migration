# Last we left off...
The party began inside the narrow corridor investigating a skeletal human body clutching a mysterious ornate silver coffer arrayed in abstract embossed designs throughout. Investigating the body further, [[Azure Flint]] managed to determine that it appeared the body did not die suddenly while trying to escape the room but instead had lied down on its back intentionally. He was also able to determine from noticing somewhat large sponge-like lesions in the bones of the skeleton that the body was very old, similar to other skeletal bodies he's seen when pilfering ancient crypts or tombs in the past. After also investigating the silver coffer further, [[Teymir]] surprisingly realized he was able to read a word woven into the embossed abstract designs on the back of the coffer, which read '[[Imoulaum]]'.

Speaking the word out loud as he read, everyone heard the sound of a lock unlatching and a silvery-white sheen passed over the coffer. Fully invested in discovering more about this coffee at this point, Teymir took the coffer out of the hands of the body and opened it, finding four transparent gems with prism-like designs throughout their bodies. They all contained a mote of soft white light at their center. The coffer also contained an ornate, well-kept time, and what looked like a lens surrounded by a bronze casing with a concave side and convex side. As [[Teymir]] spoke the word 'Imoulaum' again over each gem, you listened to various records of [[Polaris Detarish]], a noble and arrogant sounding female voice who introduced herself as a [[Maester]] of the school of [[Dunamancy]] in the [[Thultanthar]] Enclave. She mentioned she and some other mages, including a powerful abjurer named [[Iras Delacrux]], were sent to this area because it was rich with 'negative energy', which she said enhances the power of what she referred to as a 'new material' they had received from Dwarves mined out of Laerkond.

She mentioned she and her team had made contact with natives she referred to as the '[[Nexalese]]', who they were able to temporarily appease by offering gems and jewels, which these natives offered to a god they referred to as '[[Kisin]]'. It then appears that these natives and their chief named [[Yucatec]], who Polaris mentioned seemed to be delusional and oddly ashen and frail, turned on the group of mages and tried to capture and offer them to 'Kisin' to in order 'open a bridge to his eternal shore'. The mages were able to overcome the natives with the help of a mage she referred to as '[[Jhanna]]', who seemed to be affiliated with another professor she referred to as 'Ioun'. She said this 'Jhanna' managed to turn the natives to stone, some more well-preserved than others, specifically referring to some being shrunk in size.

Lasty, Polaris, under what sounded like heavy duress and oncoming hysteria, mentioned another mage, [[Telamont Tanthul]]. She mentioned a wretched book of his, which you have assumed is the tome you found in the coffer. She mentioned that the team had made their way to what she referred to as the 'first tier' of the temple and found more natives that had gone 'raving mad', which they subdued and Telamont began to study and became saying that 'they could become a weapon against the [[Phaerimm]].'

She concluded by telling you that Telamont attacked his own people in the temple at what seemed like a pinnacle point of madness, only sparing their abjurer Iras Delacrux. Polaris mentioned she barely made it out alive by using what seemed to be some kind of time spell. You then made your way to the western burial room of the temple Polaris mentioned where you found an army of life-sized stone statues of natives along with an ornate sarcophagus. Upon inspection, [[Yang Tieh]] discovered a few striking scenes painted on the side.

One scene depicted a group of tribal people raising their to the sky. From the sky looking down was what looked like a bestial face backdropped by a large sun. These tribal human figures appeared to be coming out of the ground. 2. A scene of large tribal looking ships crossing the sea, one figure drawn larger than the others pointing in the direction the ships are headed. The figure was dressed in ornate headdress, jaguar mantle, and adorned with jewels. 3. A scene of daily tribal life. The only striking thing being that many of the natives in the picture were painted with ashen colored skin wearing drab smocks with dull colors while others were dark-brown skinned with brighter colors and many wearing different decorative jewelry. They seemed to be interacting normally.

[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Azure Flint]] then investigated sarcophagus, discovering a skeletal body, taller than average in frame, outfitted in ornate jewelry, with a jade mask, great axe and its side. He also noticed no teeth except two long fangs protruding from the top of the mouth and two from the bottom. When Yang removed the figure's mask, it began to animate and the party eventually defeated it, watching as it jumped from wall to ceiling, moving much more nimbly that you would anticipate for a creature of the tall slender frame that it had. You then made your way to the eastern hallways of the temple where Yang had discovered a triangular stone wedged between the walls of the corridor and a pit of skeletal bodies lying at the base of the stone. Combining your strength you were able to push the stone open, revealing a 2ft gap between the stone and one side of the wall. You are currently deciding who will go with and squeeze through the stone and who will go with [[Tanavast Adamantus]] and [[Azure Flint]], who are not able to fit through the gap.

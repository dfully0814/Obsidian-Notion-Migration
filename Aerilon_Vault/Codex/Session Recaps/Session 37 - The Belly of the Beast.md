# Last we left off...
The raging battle for survival continued in a frigid cavern as you and a group of humanoid but goblin looking individuals fought with large centipede creatures exhibiting hunger, fire, and ice, two of which [[John Smith]] eventually felled with a well placed crossbow bolt shot, impressing the Goblinoid arcanist on the cliff who stated, "Blazbaard will want to meet you. You might be of some use." ([[Blazbaard Glagaaz]])

Meanwhile, while resolutely standing his ground against the largest centipede, Yang readied himself as the centipede's hulking body leapt into the air, coming down upon him with its maw full of razor teeth agape, swallowing him whole and then proceeding to burrow into the ice-covered rock this mountain, traveling deeper within to an unknown location.

Seeing [[Yang Tieh]] swallowed by the creature, [[Teymir]] was the first to leap into the 20ft wide hole left behind by the creature, followed by [[Robinson Fellweather]], [[Elleanna Corvus]], and then John Smith who defied the arcanist's wishes, running to the whole and anchoring a magical rope into the icy surface as he plummeted below.

You began a race against the clock as Yang's death drew ever nearer as you began working together, dodging an also plummeting dead body of a younger centipede while the large centipede continued toward its destination. Plunging his hands into the body of the creature, helped by well placed blasts of force from Ell, Robinson managed by crack open a small section of the body of the creature while Teymir teleported into the body and found Yang, reviving him and allowing the him to escape and also allowing Ell to teleport into the body and teleporting her and Teymir up to the surface.

The creature then burst through the ceiling of its destination falling 30ft to the icy floor below as a explosive glyph ignited, sending various bits of electricity, skull, brain, fire, and ice in all directions and the limp husk of the creature through a large column of ice to the ground below followed by Robinson flying in the air and Yang slowly dropped to the same ice floor below while John hangs from the rope just below the opening of the ceiling.

And that's where we pick upâ€¦

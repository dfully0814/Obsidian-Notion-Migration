# Last we left off...
While the rest of the party were out exploring [[Neverwinter]], [[Gerard Vos]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] remained in [[The Moonstone Mask]]. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] shared with [[Gerard Vos]] that he had met a man the previous evening named [[Jeremiah Phylund]]. [[Gerard Vos]] immediately recognized the name and shared with [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] that he was a man of great wealth and prestige and a fierce competitor of sorts. [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] shared that Phylund had offered him work if he needed it.

While they conversed, a dark-skinned woman of East Asian descent dressed in an elaborate black and crimson kimono, delicately wielding a long, narrow, black pipe began to descend the steps from the second floor as an almost reverent hush fell over the crowd and even the musicians briefly stopped playing. This was the flamboyant [[Ophala Marget]] who introduced herself to [[Fennis Roaringhorn]], sat down at the table, and began asking [[Gerard Vos]] about the mysterious events around his research facilities near [[Luskan]]. 

[[Ophala Marget]] shared that she and [[Brandt]] had learned that a man named [[Arthund Jamas]] was assigned as the lead investigator by the [[Everwatchers]] into the case. She said she hasn't yet been able to find anything on him that could be leveraged but she would keep looking. The three began to discuss a plan for how you might make it appear as though [[Jeremiah Phylund]] was complicit in the events at [[Vos Industries]] in [[Luskan]] and use the fact that [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] had recently been offered work by Phylund. You learned from [[Ophala Marget]] that Phylund owns a rail line that connects [[Neverwinter]] and [[Luskan]] but only leaves [[Neverwinter]] twice a week, the next departure being Sunday--two days away.

You discussed [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s particular abilities of subterfuge and cunning and how he might be able to infiltrate the crime scene and plant evidence implicating [[Jeremiah Phylund]] in the frenzied attack at the facilities. [[Ophala Marget]] told [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] that he would be compensated handsomely if he was successful but warned him that if he was apprehended at any point, he was on his own.

Meanwhile, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] continued looking around some of the recommended shops for gear. [[Teymir]] entered [[The Northern Exchange]] where he met [[Bathin Fahrend]], an expert artificer wearing a teal white and gold skirt and rounded glasses with teal-colored lenses. Most of the merchandise they came across was out of their price range so they made their way over to the more moderately-priced [[Kinsley's Imports]] operated by [[Elizabeth Kinsley]], a woman with short silver, braided hair, leather jacket with fur color, and leather pants. This shop seemed to mostly carry firearms in stock, except for a cloak [[Teymir]] saw on a stand which he was told would be 1500 gold but provide resistance against any magical effect. [[Elizabeth Kinsley]] told him she had made some of these for the [[Everwatch Knights]] themselves, many of whom wear these in battle.

As they spoke, [[Teymir]] and [[Elleanna Corvus]] saw the [[Everwatch Knights]] guard in this store walk into the back and then heard a back door open and then close and a series of footfalls follow. Looking a little flustered, [[Elizabeth Kinsley]] began to step away from the two toward the perimeter of the shop as several armed individuals wearing heavy coats and automatic weapons entered the main area of the shop. The last individual to enter was a small white-skinned Goblin figure, well groomed, wearing a black pin-striped suit, and decadent gold watch and chain hanging from the pocket. [[Teymir]] immediately recognized this as his mentor and original sponsor into the [[Valkurians]], [[Sighi Thorgison]]. 

[[Sighi Thorgison]] politely told the other patrons that the store was now closed for lunch and he looked to the [[Everwatch Knights]] guard and said, "Sargent Acox, please escort everyone out except our friend [[Teymir]] here." The knight then escorted everyone out, including [[Elleanna Corvus]] as one of the armed individuals then flipped the open sign over to closed.

[[Sighi Thorgison]] then said the following to [[Teymir]] as he began increasingly frustrated and angry:

> Teymir, at Candlekeep university they have an incredible piece of scientific equipment knows as the tunneling electrode microscope. This microscope is so powerful that by firing electrons its said you can actually see images of the atoms of the Weave itself, the infinitesimally minute building blocks of the universe. Teymir, if I had the microscope hear before us and were using it, I will wouldn't be able to find a justifiable explanation for how two men given one simple task could shovel the planet-sized mounds of horse shit onto our operations that you have over the past year. I've lost count of the number of tokens I've intercepted that have been dropped with your name on it that I've made disappear. When [[Ophala Marget]] told me a man by your description came in last night, I had a long hard study on whether or not I was gonna shoot you myself.
> I've had lots of people out looking for you. But [[Azure Flint]]'s friend [[Halia Thornton]] certainly came through. Wasn't cheap but she told me all about your uhh.."disagreement" with our dearly departed [[Captain William Acox]]. Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.
> [[Bo]] and [[Sam Lee]] have been asking about you. Don't worry. I'm keeping a good eye on 'em. You know a lot of people told me you were dead. But I said, "Hell, no. Not my boy Teymir. I trained him myself. That boy knows how to survive." And here you are.
> And if you're wondering why I didn't just come to you last night at the Mask, why go to all this trouble telling [[Alis]] which places to recommend to you, why all this pomp and big to-do. Times are uncertain right now, Teymir. The sphere of our people that can be trusted grows ever thinner. Uncertainty breeds anxiety and anxiety breeds stupidity. I just wanted you to know that everything is the way it always was. We understand one another?

[[Teymir]] mostly responded by saying there was a lot to talk about and mostly expressed a happiness to see [[Sighi Thorgison]] again. He also shared with him that [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] was alive. Not to take up the rest of the [[Teymir]]'s day, [[Sighi Thorgison]] told [[Teymir]] to come see him this evening at [[The Ring Theater]] in the [[Bluelake District]] near [[Neverwinter Castle]]. [[Teymir]] said he would bring [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]. [[Sighi Thorgison]] said he could bring any of his other companions as well to enjoy the play, but he didn't want anyone but [[Teymir]] and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] involved in their conversations. [[Sighi Thorgison]] then left the shop, followed by his bodyguards.

Meanwhile, in the [[Hall of Knowledge]], [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]] met with [[Grand Scribe Dura Sekko]], the overseer and protector of all the important histories and literature in the hall. The Grand Scribe was an old and severe man, who they learned aspired to retiring in the university of [[Candlekeep]] but was sent back to [[Neverwinter]] to oversee the reconstruction of the [[Hall of Knowledge]] after the eruption of [[Mt Hotenow]], which he viewed as a major step back for him. [[Asad Al-Nuri]] asked the Grand Scribe questions regarding the [[Sirin]] and the [[Sirin Beacons]], which the Scribe said would likely only be found in the [[Vault of Tomes]], the highly secure and top secret area of the [[Hall of Knowledge]]. 

[[Grand Scribe Dura Sekko]] shared that the overseer of the [[Vault of Tomes]] was the eccentric [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]]. The Grand Scribe shared that when [[Mt Hotenow]] erupted, the clergy sealed the [[Vault of Tomes]] and the rest of the undercroft to protect the valuable lore within, but they also accidentally sealed Freda inside. Her sanity was fractured when she was found and the clergy found her fixated on the preservation of lore at all costs. Over the next thirty years, she became an eccentric recluse who wandered the library at all hours of the day and night, compulsively categorizing and re-categorizing the collection. [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] has become antagonistic toward anyone seeking to gain entrance to the [[Vault of Tomes]] and paranoid in general due to the fact that there have been many attempts to kidnap her in order to extract some of the invaluable knowledge that only she possesses. The scribe also shared that he allows [[Loremaster Freda Hancey]] her own autonomy over the [[Vault of Tomes]] and cannot override her decisions.

As the two concluded their conversation with [[Grand Scribe Dura Sekko]], [[Asad Al-Nuri]] asked if the scribe had considered a possible succession to his position since he aspired to retire in [[Candlekeep]] and suggested [[Damien]] as a possible option, knowing that [[Damien]] had shared his love of the [[Hall of Knowledge]] and exploring the [[Vault of Tomes]] as one of the greatest aspirations of his life. At this, [[Damien]] began to apologize to [[Grand Scribe Dura Sekko]] and waved it off as preposterous.

[[Asad Al-Nuri]] then made his way back to the library proper where we read through more tomes regarding the [[Dragon Amber]] and the [[Calamity]], particularly looking for any connections to what is happening in [[Kerruma]] and particular connections to [[Septizim Gamal]]. He read how the first humanoid beings are believed to be the [[Elves]], he read about the a[[Age of Arcanum]] when mankind sought to demystify the gods, believing godhood to only be a greater wielding of the arcane. He read how the ancient magocratic nation of [[Thay]] was founded during this time and how the governing body was known as the [[Council of Eight]], a group of eight archmages each with expertise in a different school of magic. He learned the founding member was Archmage [[Alina Baenre]], Archmage of Transmutation. Another figure who caught his eye was the Archmage of Necromancy on the countil, Archmage [[Telamont Tanthul]], who he learned later incited a civil war in [[Thay]] and was later exiled to [[Aerilon]] where he laid the groundwork for what would become the empire of [[Netheril]].

The most notable detail he discovered as he began trying to make connections to [[Kerruma]] was that [[Septizim Gamal]] is a combination of a title and a tribal name for the current leader of [[Kerruma]]. His original name was [[Edmur Cassalanter]]. 

And this is where we pick up in the [[Hall of Knowledge]] as [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and [[Damien]] sit at a large desk in the library proper and [[Asad Al-Nuri]] has just discovered this major point...

#recap 
# Last we left off...

After hearing and seeing a series of laser blasts in the distance mixed with cries for help coming through the darkness of a snow-covered, forested area where you made camp for the night, [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] began to run around the camp and wake up the rest of the party to alert them of what was transpiring in the distance.

You began to take various defensive positions when [[Gerard Vos]] climbed up into a nearby tree with [[Asad Al-Nuri]] and gazed down his rifle scope to see a group of half-orcs dressed in light leathers, well-armed with high tech weapons, chasing 3 elaborately-dressed human figures (2 male, 1 female) in the direction of your camp.

[[Commander Marcus Blackwood]] stayed behind at the camp and began ordering [[Sergeant Elora Jaxon]] and [[Guardian Edward Jaxon]] to engage the half-orcs while he held the perimeter to ensure you would not be flanked from the north side of the camp.

Several of you rushed forward alongside [[Murlough Grahlund]] and the two knights to engage the half-orcs out in the valley before they could reach the camp. You watched as a half-orc sniper 300ft away in the trees began to pick off each human figure desperately trying to rush for safety--managing to gun down 2 of the 3 figures before [[Asad Al-Nuri]] teleported over into his tree and strung him up by a long length of rope until he fell unconscious.

Meanwhile, [[Elleanna Corvus]], [[Teymir]], and [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] all engaged the rest of the half-orcs when [[Teymir]] recognized the lead half-orc as an individual he had encountered previously in the [[Dessarin Valley]] who tried to kill him. As this individual passed under the tree he was hiding in, he dropped down and began to engaged the leader while the other half-orcs turned and began firing devastating shots at [[Teymir]]. [[Elleanna Corvus]] assisted by firing several well-placed Eldritch Blasts from another nearby tree before going invisible and then coming to [[Teymir]]'s aid by hypnotizing a group of the half-orcs to stop them before they could gun [[Teymir]] down.

In desperation, the half-orc leader fired an electrically charged arrow into the air, which sent out a concussive blast once it hit the ground, causing [[Murlough Grahlund]] to fall motionless to the ground while the rest of the group resisted it.

Eventually, the party managed to subdue the group of half-orcs, killing the leader, when [[Teymir]] noticed [[Fennis Roaringhorn]] crush a trinket of some sort in his hand as some form of whispy energy flowed from the half-orc into [[Fennis Roaringhorn]]'s hand.

And that's where we pick up....

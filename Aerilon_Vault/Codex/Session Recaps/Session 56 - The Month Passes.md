# Last we left off...
[[Yang Tieh]] and [[Robinson Fellweather]] managed to make their way to the mysterious island in the [[Whalebone Islands]] in pursuit of [[Aiden Zatchet]] and his apparent protectors accompanied by [[Tog]] and [[Timbre]]. When they arrived at the island they saw large pieces of what appeared to be metal distributed across the shore and some ambient light rising above a line of thick jungle. They decided to follow the source of the ambient light and entered a very thick and seemingly untraveled jungle, Yang managing to vault across various tree limbs above while Robinson kept watch from the jungle floor.

Yang soon saw all metal figures patrolling through a series of vines in the middle of the jungle with small orange orbs at each of its joints and a long jagged sabre in its hand. He and Robinson managed to keep themselves hidden from a few of these figures as they traversed through the jungle.

At one point another immense and loud crack of lightning erupted from the sky directly into the center of the island. The sound sent Yang and Robinson reeling from the volume and static energy sent throughout the entire island. Robinson watched as Yang then doubled over and began convulsing on the ground. Over what appeared only a few seconds, Robinson attempted to help Yang and determine what was happening. A very different scene began to unfold for Yang, however. He watched as the torrential downpour of rain all around him began to slow as he began to see individual droplets as they felt, even hear them.

Gradually the rain droplets soon were mixed with flakes of snow of various sizes, eventually giving over to a full downpour of snow. He watched as the foliage of the jungle around him began completely covered in snow much quicker than what would be natural. All of the thick hanging vines he had just traveled through behind him began to open in curtain-like fashion and were drawn up and over one another creating a kind of tunnel leading back the way the two had come. Yang stood up and began walking down the tunnel where he found [[Leowin Moonflower]] waiting for him dressed in a solid white ornate and sparkling dress, her blond hair tied up in a decorative bun. She was carrying a tall spear with a long blue metal handle, three blades then coming out of the handle at the top, and what appeared to be four silvered metallic gears distributed evenly down the handle.

Yang asked her if she was a god to which she responded that she didn't think so and that if she were she likely wouldn't be here since all the gods were voluntarily locked behind the [[Divine Gate]]. She told Yang that the moment she apparently died in the underground temple, she woke up in this snow covered place Yang now found himself in. She told him that a gentle and soothing presence had reached out to her and told her she had been chosen long ago and that if she would continue the path laid out before her until the end [[Auril]] would ensure she would find her way back to [[Evermeet]] to be with her family.

Leowin told Yang that he too had been chosen by Auril, resulting in their paths first crossing in the cave under [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]]. Seemingly having more openness and trust in him than she did before, she told Yang that there were some details she never told him about what happened to her in [[Laerkond]]. She told him after the time of the Founding and the war between [[Primordials]] and the gods over what creation would be (order and reason vs chaos and entropy), many cultures throughout the ages have believed myths that there are fallen primordials left on [[Toril]]. The [[Shadovar]] who kidnapped her was intent on finding one of these primordials and binding it to her by creating a powerful and ancient Elven magical effect called a [[Mythal]]. She said that her death seems to have freed her from the effect of this Mythal but she does not know the whereabouts of whatever entity was bound to her.

She then told Yang that the [[Everwatchers]] and other cultures of Toril intent on technological advancement have begun binding who she referred to as "children of Auril" to their various machinations to increase their power and scale and that Auril wants it stopped. She handed Yang the spear and told him that Auril would bestow her boons upon him for any of her children that he is able to free and that she also would be with him to guide him as long as he kept the spear close. She laid her hand on one of the gears and Yang awoke back in the jungle only a few seconds later from Robinson's perspective seeing the first gear on the spear glowing with a blue light and seeming to have turned and locked in place.

They continued to make their way out of the jungle and saw a large U-shaped facility built into a 50ft deep crater in the ground where large black and gold colored aircraft each with large doors that seemed to lower allowing for a significant number of passengers. These aircraft were docked with gang planks attached to each one leading into the facility. Each also had a large orange metal tank that was cylindrical in shape attached to the back with a bright ball of electrical energy pulsating in it. They then saw the [[Aiden Zatchet]], [[Captain Riffolk Salte]], [[Barbara]], and a crimson and white robed figure standing outside the facility talking, surrounded by many more of the robotic figures they saw in the jungle. They watched as Zatchet seemed to walk up and hand something to the robed figure.

The group dropped down into the crater and began making their way to the one aircraft that seemed to be in the process of preparations for taking off. As Yang and Robinson, who were invisible, neared the aircraft Yang entered onto the aircraft first. As he stepped on, a defense mechanism seemed to trigger and he watched as his invisibility immediately dissolved. Being seen by one of the robotic figures, a fight ensued among the whole group.

Seeing that they were hopelessly surrounded, Yang ran behind the aircraft and plunged his spear into the large cylindrical tank attached to it. The light inside of it began to pulse and thrum as the tank itself exploded with a loud crack sending large orange shrapnel in all directions and knocking him back on the ground. In sentient fashion, the ball of light began to grow electrical tendrils and pulled itself out of the tanks location onto the ground and quickly began growing to an immense size up to 15ft tall. In chaotic fashion it then began to indiscriminately attack the facility and all those around as its immense body began to form into a large bolt of lightning and pass through aircraft, the facility, and bodies. As explosions and chaos ensued all around, the group managed to apprehend Zatchet and make off with him before being consumed in the attack with everyone and everything else.

Having taken longer than the limit given to them by [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]], the four made it back to the other end of the island seeing only the broken and destroyed [[Fortunate Son]] anchored in the same place they left it, having been buffeted and beaten by battle and the torrential storm. Not knowing if Salt and his officers had survived the attack on the facility or not, Robinson quickly contacted his long-time friend [[Azure Flint]] who he knew to frequently sail this area of the [[Sea of Swords]]. After taking shelter the _Fortunate Son_ from the ongoing storm and waiting for his arrival, the group saw the [[Anguila]] approaching in the distance.

As they boarded the _Aguila_ along with [[Tog]], [[Timbre]], and Zatchet, the crew set off for the 3 day journey back to the coast. During that time, Yang and Robinson began to interrogate Zatchet and coerce information from him regarding the nature of his traveling to these mysterious islands and his connection to the Everwatchers. He told them that he had an Everwatcher contact who paid him a large sum of money in addition to offering free passage over several profitable slave trading routes throughout the Trackless Sea. The payment was offered for evidence of a cover up by the Everwatchers regarding a location somewhere on the sea where they have been shipping increasing numbers of [[Aerilon]] citizens. He no longer had the evidence in his possession as he had already handed it over while on the island. He told you that the evidence was a recording gem but he didn't know it's contents because it had been warded and locked. He never knew the contact's name as that was very emphatically held from him. He was only told a location and date to meet. The location and date was passed to him by a man named [[Gerard Vos]] out of [[Yartar]] who enlists his resources from time to time. He also received warning ahead of the attack on [[Amphail]] from Vos, which is why he left early the day before in exchange for some favors Vos needed from him.

He also told Robinson that he used to indeed by [[Lord Symund Cassalanter]] but assumed a different name after he fell out of favor with the Cassalanter family when his brother Aldous suddenly disappeared one early evening seemingly out of thin air while he and their family were spending the winter at their mountain villa. His father [[Bertio Cassalanter]] held him responsible as a derelict older brother and disavowed him. After that day he began to realize that he would never get tired anymore and no longer felt the need for sleep and also hasn't aged since that day. He recognized Robinson as a former Cassalanter whom he and a group of the family framed for murder in order for Robinson's cousin [[Vyncis Casslanter]] to step in and take over a lucrative research and development business that Robinson owned.

He didn't know much about the current state of [[Thornhold]] as the two also asked him about those events.

The crew eventually made it to the coast, Robinson and Yang took Zatchet to [[Alas Grahlund]]'s estate, Robinson choosing to stay with Grahlund at his home for the time being. Grahlund seemed to have several questions for Zatchet as well so Yang said his goodbyes to Robinson and Grahlund and joined Captain Azure Flint's crew.

After narrowly escaping the hidden bounty hunters in the forest near the farm, [[Elleanna Corvus]] and [[Teymir]] fled for a few miles on horseback, putting distance between themselves and their pursuers. They spent the night setting up watch rotations to rest up, and to prepare for a long journey to the hideout of a friend of Teymir's a few day’s journey away.

Upon arrival at the hideout, Ell and Teymir met up with [[Tamerland Quixat]], a clever Goliath is known to Teymir from some of his earliest memories. They helped Tamerland and followed orders to fake their deaths. For their own safety and plausible deniability, Tamerland did not disclose he would go about doing so but eventually told the two that the task was complete.

After some quick congratulations and merry enjoyment of drinks, it was then time to get to work on the horses the two had acquired from a local horse farm. They weren’t well trained, and Tamerland knew his way around them, so Ell and Teymir trained with them until they were comfortable riding, fighting, and commanding the horses along with all other aspects of their care.

Throughout, Ell and Teymir bonded and grew closer, cementing their trust in each other in combat, skills, and interactions, working together to overcome any obstacle set before them. They were also able to update their appearances and now sport new clothing so as not to be as recognizable.

Teymir spent a lot more time in meditation, speaking with [[Rushnaa]], attempting/refining communication with [[Dunamis]]. He also spent a lot of time reading the books he has, working through the details of the last few weeks.

Once Tamerland was convinced Ell and Teymir were confident and skilled enough, he deemed their training complete, and requested that they do him a favor in [[Yartar]], a few days journey away. Ell and Teymir set out to clear their debt to him with new looks, new gear, horses, restocked resources, and newfound trust in each other’s ability and motivations. And that’s where they left off…

Narration:

Life moves fast in a world where efficiency, innovation, and ingenuity are the greatest virtues. A lot can happen in a short period of time. War has come to the kingdom of Aerilon. When undercover [[Thayan]] spies discovered there was leftover [[Mythallar]] technology in the land of Aerilon they reported back to Thay's [[Zulkirs]] (the lead wizards of Thay's government). The Mythallar is regarded as a holy relic by the magocratic government of Thay and its presence in Aerilon and supposed use was the gravest of sacrilege to Zulkir [[Szass Tam]], one of Thay's eight Zulkirs. 

After over a year of planning, scouting, and lying in wait the Thayans seized the opportunity of extreme upheaval in Aerilon as their spies began to witness a strange malady that seems to have begun permeating the population.

This was the Thayan's time to strike. Under the leadership of General [[Thrul Kren]] a large magically powered Thayan fleet sailed out of the island port of [[Alaor]] lead by Kren's feared flagship The [[Red Scourge]] also leading all manner of magical beasts not seen in [[Toril]] since before The [[Calamity]].

Fleets of Everwatcher vessels met them in the [[Sea of Fallen Stars]], which began the first battles of this ensuing conflict. However, the Everwatchers suffered significant casualties, not realizing the full power and potential the Red Wizards of Thay had brought with them.

A sizable Thayan force of tens of thousands landed on the outskirts of the neutral nation of [[Cormanthyr]], one of the most prosperous nations outside of [[Waterdeep]], quickly overtaking it, forcing surrender, and establishing a stronghold there from which they have begun to launch small coordinated attacks on strategic locations across Aerilon.

Meanwhile, in the [[Uncharted North]], an ancient frost giant tribe, lead by [[Jarl Storvald]] has overthrown most of the small Outlander hamlets of [[Ironhaven]] and is currently plans a full-scale assault on [[Bryn Shander]], one of the Ironhaven's largest settlements, which would most certainly mean the acquisition of all of Ironhaven for the tribe.

Ell and Teymir, you've been sent by Tamerlund to Yartar to recruit a crew for a job Tamerlund is planning, the details of which he didn't divulge. He's told you he needs men or women who could fill the following roles:

-   A safe-cracker
-   A roper: Puts a mark into a position to be conned like a seductress and the like
-   A muscle
-   A fall guy

It's the time of the local [[Hiring Faire]] in Yartar. You're sitting in a local pub known as the [[The Winter Winds]]. A game of dueling has begun just outside, typical during the Hiring Faire.

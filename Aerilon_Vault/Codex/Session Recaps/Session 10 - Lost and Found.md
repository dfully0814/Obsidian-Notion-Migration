#recap 
# Last we left off...

After a narrow escape from the cavern and top of the [[Skyhorn Lighthouse]] cliff, [[Yang Tieh]] and the girl he saved found themselves looking up at the 4 [[Drow]] figures that had chased them to the [[Dawn Chaser]]. The Drow woman began intently searching across the ship while the other 3 Drow male figures began making hand gestures that appeared to be some sort of sign language. Yang and Leowin then heard a voice in their heads saying, **"We are patient little butterfly. When your rebirth is complete, you will come and find us."** The 4 figures then flew back toward the lighthouse instead the cliff face of the island, appearing to meld into the rock face itself and disappearing.

The party watched as the girl split a 200 ft. tidal wave into two walls of water that wrapped around the boat, leaving the boat safe in the large gap in between. The party then watched as the massive wave joined together again on the other side of the boat and continued hurling toward the shoreline. Exhausted, the party spent the first day resting and nursing their wounds. Before taking an almost 48 hour rest, [[Azure Flint]] opened the bottle of swirling blue, red, and green smoke that formed into 3 separate cryptic messages on small pieces of paper.

Angered by her apparent display of lack of loyalty to the party, [[Teymir]] confronted [[Captain Avareen Moonlight]] at the helm of the ship, which almost erupted into combat when Teymir deescalated the situation some and ended up getting some information from Moonlight about Lyrala being some noteworthy figure of [[House Xorlarrin]] who she worked with through an intermediary in order to find out the location of [[Aryn Hest]]. She didn't know anything else about the woman. The confrontation ended with Moonlight seeing **Teymir** as immature and not worthy of her time and **Teymir** threatening to kill Moonlight with his bare hands. [[John Smith]] had a conversation the first evening with [[Tog]], which resulted in **Tog** revealing to John Smith that the Drow sword he took seems to disintegrate in the sunlight and gave John a new sword.

The first night, Yang noticed sparks of some sort shooting across and through his finger tips. He noticed sparks were emitted when he touched the wooded floor, but when he touched the girl, the bulging blue veins in her neck started to recede and she became increasingly stable, although the ability seemed to be drained from his hands for a time after doing this. After helping her to consciousness with his newfound electrical abilities in his hands, **Yang** and **Teymir** interacted with the girl, watching her shift from calm and clear on much of her background to scared and much more gentle in her demeanor. When electricity seemed to spark in her eyes, she could speak Elven, but when she would shift to her more gentle demeanor, she could only speak Common.

They found out her name was [[Leowin Moonflower]], memories of her home involved lots of clear water, green as far as you can see, and birds of all colors flying through the air. In her more docile state, the girl went on to tell **Teymir** that she didn't believe the Xorlarrin Drow were after her to begin with before changing to her other state once again. **Yang** had a productive conversation with **Captain Moonlight** in which she warned him about **Teymir's** immaturity and naivety and how he's likely to get himself killed. She also told **Yang** that she recognizes how formidable and disciplined he seems to be to accomplishing difficult tasks and offered him a possible spot on her crew if he was interested. In return, he offered to potentially help her with her ongoing business she was trying to address through shooting a man named **Aryn** in the lighthouse cave.

She told him that if he did prove useful in helping her she might offer him passage back to the island to see what might have been taken by the Drow or salvage any important items left there. She also gave him one of the more crudely drawn maps from the wall of her captain's quarters wall when he told her he had not traveled much or seen much of the world. The session concluded as **Teymir** gathered the rest of the party together aboard the ship expressing his concern regarding the prospect of simply handing the girl over to the **Valkurians** when they arrived in [[Waterdeep]]. He is concerned that since there seems to be some breach in security around [[Thornhold]] there may also be one in Waterdeep. The party began discussing a plan to sneak into Waterdeep and hide the girl in a safe house somewhere until they can better understand the security of the cell around them or get more information regarding what's going on.

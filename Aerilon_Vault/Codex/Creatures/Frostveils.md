# Behavior
# Appearance
Flat nodes shaped like large snowflakes connect their net-like bodies and trailing tails of transparent fibers. Gossamer tendrils stream behind and between the flying snowflakes, ready to grab and entangle any warm-blooded creature it detects
# Abilities
Each star-like node contains crude sensory organs, able to detect warmth as meager as a living creature’s breath and steer the gliding web toward it
# History
Whipped through the air by snowstorms and resembling a spider’s web dangling with delicate ice crystals, these silently gliding, beautiful killers are semi-sentient plants adapted to the merciless cold of the [[Uncharted North]].

The tribes of the [[Uncharted North]] such as the [[Ruith]] and [[Cahokia]] say the dance of the frostveils is beautiful when lit by the northern lights, and a powerful omen. With great care, Northern tribesmen sometimes harvest frostveils for their frozen spore-shards, which grant potent visions of the spirit world when melted on the tongue.

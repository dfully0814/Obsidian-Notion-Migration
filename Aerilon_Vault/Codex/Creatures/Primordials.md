Believed to be the first sentient entities to exist during the [[Founding]]. Amazed with the power and vibrancy of their children, the [[Sirin]] wanted to guide them to learn of themselves, which in turn would help the [[Sirin]] discover their own purposeâ€”but the children warred among themselves and grew power hungry and chaotic, becoming the first [[Betrayer Gods]] who rose up against the [[Prime Deities]], those primordials who were not consumed in chaos, resulting in the [[Calamity]].
